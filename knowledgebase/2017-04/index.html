	      <p>As developers, we hear a non-stop stream of
		technical-but-marketing messages for containers,
		orchestration tools, and cloud services. There is
		extensive overlap in these areas with regard to both
		means and ends, and it's time to clear the fog and get
		to the bottom of things. This talk will give a quick
		overview from a hardcore developer's perspective of
		the following topics:</p>

	      <ul>
		<li>How can I use containers to develop better software?</li>
		<li>What are orchestration tools? Do I need to
		  consider/use them?</li>
		<li>How do cloud/PaaS options compare? What are the
		  tradeoffs?</li>
		<li>What is the difference?</li>
		<li>Why should I care? (Or should I?)</li>
	      </ul>

	      <p>In this session, the presenter discusses several of
		these technologies, compares them, and _deploys real
		applications to them LIVE_ to demonstrate subtle
		differences and tradeoffs each choice imposes upon
		developers, for better or worse. Come to this session
		to level up on containers, clouds, and developing real
		production software, regardless of where or how you
		deploy it.</p>

	      <p>Audience Takeaways/Learning Outcomes</p>

	      <p>Participants will learn:</p>

	      <ul>
		<li>how to use containers to develop better software</li>
		<li>what orchestration tools are available</li>
		<li>what cloud/PaaS options are available</li>
		<li>what are the differences/tradeoffs</li>
		<li>why they should care!</li>
	      </ul>
	      
	      <p>Prerequisite Knowledge:</p>

	      <p>Knowledge of containers and/or PaaS platforms is
		helpful, but not required.</p>
