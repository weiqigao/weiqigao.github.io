              <p>This presentation introduces the audience to the
              power of Gradle through many real-world examples that
              are demonstrated. By the end of the presentation, you'll
              understand how Gradle helps to elegantly solve the
              challenges that we face in our daily builds. We'll go
              through such powerful concepts as: advantages of
              declarative over imperative build systems, convention
              over configuration without rigidity, the Gradle plugins,
              deep multiâ€“project support, performance optimizations
              through partial builds and incrementalness, harvesting
              existing functionality through Ant and Maven
              integration, as well as migration strategies for
              migrating from these build tools. We will demonstrate
              many of the innovative goodies that come with Gradle
              out-of-the-box, like the Gradle Daemon, the Gradle
              Wrapper, easy administration of your build environment,
              building Android apps and libraries, Eclipse
              integration, and other new plugins.</p>
