	   <td colspan="3" valign="top" class="body">
	     <p>In this talk, we'll survey the web services exposed by
	     leading websites (Google, Yahoo, Amazon, eBay) and
	     discuss how they are driving the AJAX revolution. You'll
	     see examples of RESTful, SOAP, and JSON web services, as
	     well as the strengths and weaknesses of each.</p>

	     <p>Everyone seems to be talking about AJAX and Web 2.0
	     these days. While the UIs of AJAX-enabled websites such
	     as Google Maps and Flickr are undeniably cool, they
	     wouldn't exist without a strong SOA/Web Services
	     infrastructure behind the scenes. </p>

	     <p>"Web Services" is an overloaded term. While SOAP is a
	     mainstay in the web services world, there are other
	     equally valid flavors (REST, JSON) that accomplish the
	     same goal -- decoupling the data from the presentation
	     layer, the platform, and even the programming language
	     used.</p>

	     <p>Rather than talking about web services in the
	     abstract, this talk shows examples of each flavor of web
	     services as it is used in the wild by leading web
	     companies. They have all taken slightly different
	     approaches to the same problem. We'll compare and
	     contrast their public-facing offerings.</p>

	     <p>There is no one "right way" to expose your API via web
	     services. After this talk, you should have a better idea
	     of the relative strengths and weaknesses of each
	     variant.</p>

	    project).</p>

	    <p>He is the co-author of JBoss At Work, quite possibly
	    the world's first agile J2EE book. He is also responsible
