	      <p>Hazelcast is a small Java library that is provided
                under Apache 2 license. You simply include in your
                application and you get distributed collection classes
                like Map, List, Set, Queue and Topic as well as
                distributed computing utilities like locking, executor
                service and map-reduce. Once embedded, Hazelcast nodes
                automatically discover each other and elastically join
                to pool the machines memory and processors. This
                hands-on talk will enable you to get started exploring
                Hazelcast and help you to see how it can give your
                project a jump start in performance and
                scalability.</p>
