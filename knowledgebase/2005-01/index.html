The Future of Object Persistence

The recent announcement by Sun Microsystems about the EJB and JDO
specification teams collaborating on a common persistence API was
driven by requests from the Java community. The collaboration will
result in the development of a new specification that incorporates the
best of parts of the JDO and EJB standards. Like JDO, this common
persistence API will work in and out of the container. Additionally,
JDO 2.0 will continue to push forward, sharing many aspects of the new
persistence specification e.g., object/relational mapping metadata,
but adding functionality that will go beyond the scope of the new
persistence specification. In this presentation, we will highlight the
current status of the new persistence specification and the details of
the JDO 2 specification. We will highlight how developers can use the
JDO specification, available today, as the perfect migration path to
the new persistence specification and how products supporting both
specifications can provide interoperability between the two standards.
Finally, in this presentation, we will highlight criteria to look at
when you evaluate different persistence solutions.</p></td>
