	   <td colspan="3" valign="top" class="body">Never before has so little code done so much! AOP is becoming a major tool for implementing certain kinds of functionality. This talk covers the benefits and the terminology used in describing AOP frameworks. It then covers the two most popular AOP frameworks for Java, AspectJ and AspectWerkz. An example is worked out in both so they can be directly compared. Two other frameworks, Nanning and Prose are also briefly described. Finally, a recommendation backed by lots of rationale is given.</td>
