              <p>
WAX stands for Writing API for XML. It's a new approach to writing XML that
</p><ul>
  <li>requires less code than other approaches</li>
  <li>uses less memory than other approaches</li>
(because it outputs XML as each method is called rather than
storing it in a DOM-like structure and outputting it later)
  <li>doesn't depend on any Java classes other than standard JDK classes</li>
  <li>is a small library (&lt; 10K)</li>
  <li>requires Java 5 or later (at least for now)</li>
  <li>understands all XML node types</li>
  <li>never outputs XML that isn't well-formed without throwing an exception</li>
  <li>provides extensive error checking</li>
  <li>automatically escapes special characters in text and attribute values when error checking is turned on</li>
  <li>allows all error checking to be turned off for performance</li>
  <li>knows how to associate DTDs, XML Schemas and XSLT stylesheets with the XML it outputs</li>
  <li>is well-suited for writing XML request and response messages for REST-based and SOAP-based services</li>
</ul>
