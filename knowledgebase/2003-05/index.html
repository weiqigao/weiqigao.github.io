	   <td colspan="3" valign="top" class="body">JAXB is a specification for "XML Binding" that was developed through
the Java Community Process.  Implementations generate Java classes
from XML Schemas.  Marshaller and Unmarshaller classes can marshal
and unmarshal objects of the generated class types to and from XML.
These objects can be validated according to rules expressed in the
XML Schema.  Having these capabilities greatly reduces the need to
use the SAX and DOM APIs.  Many customization options can be specified
in the XML Schema used to generate the classes.  This session covers
the features of JAXB and the steps required to use the reference
implementation.</td>
