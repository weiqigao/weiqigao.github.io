<p class="bodysubtitle_java">JavaServer Pages Standard Tag Library (JSTL)
<p><b>by Dean Wette, Object Computing, Inc</b></p>
<p class="bodysubtitle_java">About the Presentation
<hr>
JSTL encapsulates, as simple tags, core functionality common to many JSP applications. For example, instead of
iterating over collections using scriptlets or proprietary iteration tags, JSTL defines a standard <forEach> tag that
works the same everywhere.
<P>
JSTL provides support for core iteration and control-flow features, text inclusion, I18n and formatting tags, XML-
and XSLT-manipulation tags, and tags for SQL database access. It also supports an expression language (EL) -
inspired by ECMAScipt and Xpath - to simplify page development without requiring expertise in the Java
programming language.
<P>
JSTL is a new specification from the Java Community Process (JCP) and comes out of the JSR-052 Expert Group.
The reference implementation is provided by the Jakarta Project (jakarta.apache.com), and is currently available
as JSTL 1.0.2.<P>
