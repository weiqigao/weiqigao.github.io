	      <p>Join us for an exploration of testing a reactive
		Spring Boot 2.x application. Test driven development
		gives us the confidence necessary to improve our code
		faster, safely. But how do you test components and
		services, as well as integrations across distributed
		systems, while maintaining fast feedback loops, and
		how do you do all of this within the context of
		reactive Java? In this talk, we'll look at how to test
		imperative components, reactive data flows, and
		mocks. We’ll examine how to take advantage of test
		slices, and how to test web applications. We'll look
		at how to ensure that API producers and consumers work
		well together using consumer driven contract testing
		without sacrificing the testing pyramid for end-to-end
		integration tests. And we’ll do it all within the
		context of reactive programming.</p>
