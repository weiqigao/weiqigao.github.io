	      <p>Three evolutionary ecosystems work well together:
		Java, Containers, and Kubernetes.</p>

	      <p>Past versions of Java were never designed to be
		"container aware." This has led some to stray away
		from the JVM and consider other shiny languages. But
		wait, before you go, let's discover what Java 9, 10,
		11, 12, 13, etc. has done to get our applications into
		efficiently distilled containers that pack nicely into
		Kubernetes.</p>

	      <p>Topics covered:
		<ul>
		  <li>Microframeworks</li>
		  <li>Java9+, advancing beyond the troubled past</li>
		  <li>Java run-time to container run-time - a paradigm
		    shift for "run anywhere"</li>
		  <li>Distillation pattern - small containers with a
		    reduced attack vector</li>
		  <li>Multi-stage Dockerfile</li>
		  <li>JLink, JDeps</li>
		  <li>GraalVM</li>
		  <li>Hands on example</li>

		class="body">
	      <p>Jonathan Johnson is an independent software architect
		with a concentration on helping others unpack the
		riches in the cloud native and Kubernetes
		ecosystems.</p>

	      <p>Jonathan is halfway into his second score of
		engineering commercial software, driven by his desire
		to design helpful software to move us forward. His
		applications began with laboratory instrument software
		and managing its data. Jonathan was enticed by the
		advent of object-oriented design to develop personal
		banking software. Banking soon turned to the internet,
		and enterprise applications took off. Java exploded
		onto the scene, and since then he has inhabited that
		ecosystem. At 454 Life Sciences and Roche Diagnostics,
		Jonathan returned to laboratory software and leveraged
		Java-based state machines and enterprise services to
		manage the terabytes of data flowing out of DNA
		sequencing instruments. Then as a hands-on architect
		at Thermo Fisher Scientific, he applied the advantages
		of microservices, containers, and Kubernetes to their
		laboratory management platform.</p>

	      <p>Jonathan enjoys comparing and sharing his adventures
		with peers. He shares ways to modernize application
		architectures while adhering to the fundamentals of
		high modularity and low coupling.</p>
