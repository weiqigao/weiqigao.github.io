              <p>Maybe you've heard of GitHub and haven't started
              playing with it yet, or maybe you've created a profile
              but haven't added much to it.  What's stopping you from
              showing the world what you know and love?</p>
              <p>In this talk, we'll walk through common entry points
              to getting started in open source communities as well as
              advantages to putting our own projects on GitHub.</p>
