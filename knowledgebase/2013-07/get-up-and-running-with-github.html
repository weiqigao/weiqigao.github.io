<h3>STLJUG</h3>

<h2>Outline</h2>

<p>Bio pic slide with some information and welcome message:
  * email (both brent@github.com and training@github.com maybe?)
  * twitter handle
  * training site URL
  * maybe also include gerbil pic as icebreaker. it's ok to be funny, or try.
  * Also nice to say, part of a team of X trainers, or something, as people like to relate to the group of us sometimes.</p>

<p>Outline slide:
  * Project we worked on locally. Lets share this with the world.
    * Intro commands for local
        * git init
        * git add
        * git commit
    * Then finally the push
        * git push (to what)
        * git remote -v
        * git fetch?
  * Project we've found that we want to contribute to, maybe we found it from following
    another developer on GitHub
    * New stars page?
    * Explore page for Java? https://github.com/languages/Java</p>

<h3>Have a project, want to share it / show it off</h3>

<ul>
<li>setup / config</li>
<li>init</li>
<li>add / commit</li>
<li><p>push (http!)</p></li>
<li><p>Ok, now we have it up there. let's talk about what this opens up for us now</p>

<ul>
<li>people can discover our things</li>
<li>we can point people to a URL (always be accessable)</li>
<li>URLs are human readable and permanent. We love stable URLs. It is how the web works.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>We should probably also make things easy to get up and running.</p>

<ul>
<li>README.md is key.
<ul>
<li>How the Windows client shows it even before you clone the repo by using the API</li>
<li>How it shows up in the web UI, rendered</li>
</ul></li>
<li>CONTRIBUTING.md
<ul>
<li>How this affects the UI during a pull request?</li>
<li>Show a repo that has one of these wired in with the hyperlink showing during the PR process</li>
</ul></li>
<li>LICENSE.md</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<h3>Project on GitHub I want to contribute to</h3>

<p>There's lots of projects out there. Some of them have sadly not been getting
much love lately. There's a few ways we can get to work with these projects: 
we can either attempt to revive them by filing an issue for something thats missing
or we can ship code.</p>

<ul>
<li>Go to ratpack/ratpack</li>
<li>fork then clone
<ul>
<li>what is a fork? why?</li>
</ul></li>
<li>look at logs with log / diff?
<ul>
<li>possibly just look at this stuff on the UI</li>
</ul></li>
<li>branch (because why not)</li>
<li>push you branch to your fork</li>
<li>send pull request (there's about 5 ways, which is best?)
<ul>
<li>look at pulse page, find out who's best to maybe /cc?</li>
<li>maybe cc someone who's not the top contributor</li>
</ul></li>
<li>have a conversation with the maintainer if applicible
<ul>
<li>show my doorkeeper conversations</li>
<li>https://github.com/applicake/doorkeeper-provider-app/pull/7</li>
</ul></li>
<li>update your fork</li>
</ul>

<p>One thing we should fix is documentation. Point people to some docs? i dunno
* Does it have a README/LICENSE/CONTRIBUTING like we listed above?
* Is it missing tests?
  * Maybe we don't know how to write the tests or set them up but we can file an
    Issue</p>
