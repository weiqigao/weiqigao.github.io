### STLJUG

## Outline

Bio pic slide with some information and welcome message:
  * email (both brent@github.com and training@github.com maybe?)
  * twitter handle
  * training site URL
  * maybe also include gerbil pic as icebreaker. it's ok to be funny, or try.
  * Also nice to say, part of a team of X trainers, or something, as people like to relate to the group of us sometimes.

Outline slide:
  * Project we worked on locally. Lets share this with the world.
    * Intro commands for local
        * git init
        * git add
        * git commit
    * Then finally the push
        * git push (to what)
        * git remote -v
        * git fetch?
  * Project we've found that we want to contribute to, maybe we found it from following
    another developer on GitHub
    * New stars page?
    * Explore page for Java? https://github.com/languages/Java

### Have a project, want to share it / show it off
* setup / config
* init
* add / commit
* push (http!)

* Ok, now we have it up there. let's talk about what this opens up for us now
  * people can discover our things
  * we can point people to a URL (always be accessable)
  * URLs are human readable and permanent. We love stable URLs. It is how the web works.

* We should probably also make things easy to get up and running.
  * README.md is key.
      * How the Windows client shows it even before you clone the repo by using the API
      * How it shows up in the web UI, rendered
  * CONTRIBUTING.md
      * How this affects the UI during a pull request?
      * Show a repo that has one of these wired in with the hyperlink showing during the PR process
  * LICENSE.md


### Project on GitHub I want to contribute to
There's lots of projects out there. Some of them have sadly not been getting
much love lately. There's a few ways we can get to work with these projects: 
we can either attempt to revive them by filing an issue for something thats missing
or we can ship code.

* Go to ratpack/ratpack
* fork then clone
  * what is a fork? why?
* look at logs with log / diff?
  * possibly just look at this stuff on the UI
* branch (because why not)
* push you branch to your fork
* send pull request (there's about 5 ways, which is best?)
  * look at pulse page, find out who's best to maybe /cc?
  * maybe cc someone who's not the top contributor
* have a conversation with the maintainer if applicible
  * show my doorkeeper conversations
  * https://github.com/applicake/doorkeeper-provider-app/pull/7
* update your fork


One thing we should fix is documentation. Point people to some docs? i dunno
* Does it have a README/LICENSE/CONTRIBUTING like we listed above?
* Is it missing tests?
  * Maybe we don't know how to write the tests or set them up but we can file an
    Issue

### Extras
* Issues
* Milestones
* In line comments
* Things that should go into your project (contributing.md, license.md)
* GFM
* explore
