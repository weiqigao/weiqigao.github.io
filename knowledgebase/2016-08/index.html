		class="body">
	      <p>Jenkins 2.0 was recently released with a focus on the
		use case of a continuous delivery pipeline.  In order
		to make the move from continuous integration to
		continuous delivery, teams need a flexible way to
		model, orchestrate and visualize their entire delivery
		pipeline.  This is why they added the pipeline
		capability to Jenkins 2.0.  This new capability comes
		in the form of "Pipeline as Code," using a
		Groovy-based DSL that can be version-controlled with
		the rest of a project's source code.  In this talk, we
		will use a Docker containerized web application as an
		example to look at the Jenkins DSL.  We will also look
		at the new user interface, "Ocean Blue," and its
		tie-in to pipelines.</p>
