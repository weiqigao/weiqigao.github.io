	     <p>First, this talk will show how to plug in scripting
	     capability to your application, using common scripting
	     mechanisms, including those from the scripting related
	     JSRs (223, 274, etc), and point out the tradeoffs in
	     selecting a scripting mechanism and/or language. Then the
	     bulk of the talk will focus on the questions of Why and
	     Where: the motivations for scripting support, areas of an
	     application that warrant such support, and placement of
	     scripting plug-points across client/server application
	     tiers. Lastly, it will address script/application API
	     design and plugability, including the ideal of an
	     end-to-end script plugin.</p>
