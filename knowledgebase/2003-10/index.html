is a light weight, embeddable, Java source interpreter with a 
minimal footprint of less than 150K. In addition to executing standard Java 
expressions dynamically, BeanShell extends Java into the scripting domain in a 
natural way by adding loose types, method closures, commands, and other obvious 
scripting language features. BeanShell can be easily embedded in your app, 
allowing you to freely pass "live" objects into scripts and back, making it 
ideal an ideal extension, configuration, and testing language.
<p> 
With version 2.0 BeanShell becomes a fully Java compatible scripting language, 
capable of interpreting ordinary Java source and loading .java source files 
from the class path. BeanShell scripted classes are fully typed and appear to 
outside Java code and via reflective inspection as ordinary classes. However 
their implementation is fully dynamic and they may include arbitrary BeanShell 
scripts in their bodies, methods, and constructors. Users may now freely mix 
loose, unstructured BeanShell scripts, method closures, and full scripted 
classes. Additionally, BeanShell 2.0 adds new JDK1.5 language features such 
as the enhanced for-loop, static imports, as well as a new object feature: 
the mix-in.
<p> 
BeanShell is licensed under the LGPL and is is widely distributed with the JDE 
for Emacs, BEA's Weblogic application server, Sun's NetBeans/Forte, and many 
other commercial and non commercial apps. It also serves as the core macro 
language for the popular jEdit programmers editor.</td>
