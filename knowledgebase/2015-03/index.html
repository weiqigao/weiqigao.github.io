	      <p>Machine learning is a technology that allows
		computers to learn from data.  It is an important
		concept in the growing field of data science.  The
		interaction between data science and machine learning
		will be covered.  Machine learning will be introduced
		with one of the Kaggle (http://www.kaggle.com/)
		tutorial competitions. Data wrangling techniques will
		be covered to get data into a format that a machine
		can learn from.  You will see how the machine learning
		feature vector is built, and what tradeoffs must
		sometimes be considered.</p>

	      <p>This presentation starts with the very simple data
		conversions that all programmers perform every day.
		These conversions can be abstracted into simple linear
		regression.  The presentation will move from linear
		regression to deep learning.  Simple Java source code
		will illustrate each step.  Along the way, multiple
		linear regression, GLM (generalized linear
		regression), and neural networks are covered.  You
		will see how each of these technologies builds upon
		the previous one.</p>
