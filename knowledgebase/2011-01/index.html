	      <p>First, I will briefly summarize the need for
	      fine-grained parallelism.  Then, I will present three
	      code walkthrough examples in Java:</p>
	      <ol> 
		<li> 
		  The word-count problem from Guy Steele√ïs Stange Loop talk.
		</li> 
		<li> 
		  Another simple algorithmic/computer-science-flavored example.
		</li> 
		<li> 
		  As time allows, a third example from a thoroughly practical,
		  enterprise-app-flavored problem space.
		</li> 
	      </ol>
	      <p>This talk will use very few slides. Instead it will
	      be all about the code. Each example will show how (not
	      just why) to parallelize algorithms.</p>
