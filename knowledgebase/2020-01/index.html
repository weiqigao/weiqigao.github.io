		class="body">
	      <p>Every business going through an organizational
		transformation to gain a competitive advantage faces
		the same challenge: how do we balance agility and
		stability?  To solve for the agility part of this
		equation, many development and operations teams are
		turning to continuous integration (CI) and continuous
		development/deployment (CD), however, these practices
		often put stability at risk. Enter Continuous
		Reliability.</p>

	      <p>Continuous Reliability (CR) is a new framework that
		brings together automated code quality gates and
		contextual feedback loops within a CI/CD workflow to
		help organizations overcome the agility/stability
		paradox. CR can mean the difference between hoping
		your code might work in production, and actually
		knowing it will.</p>

	      <p>In this session, Rich Borucki will define CR for
		attendees and demonstrate how they can implement this
		practice within the context of their organizationâ€™s
		own transformation.</p>

	      <p>The session will follow the below outline:
		<ul>
		  <li>Introduce and define the concept of CR Quality
		    Gates Feedback Loops</li>
		  <li>How are enterprise organizations approaching
		    this problem today and the challenges they are
		    encountering</li>
		  <li>The benefits of CR</li>
		  <li>CR in Practice: How CR is implemented at
		    Comcast</li>
		  <li>Key tools and best practices</li>
		  <li>Q&amp;A</li>
