<p>
Prior to J2SE 1.4, Java was relatively weak in facilities for text
processing.  Input and output processing was accomplished most
typically with use of the String, StringBuffer, and related classes,
the conversion utilities of the wrapper classes, and formatting
facilities in the java.text package. While useful, these facilities
are limited, and clearly less desirable for solving these kinds of
problems compared to languages, such as Perl, that provide regular
expression features.
</p>

<p>
Thankfully, J2SE 1.4 introduced support for regular expressions in the
java.util.regex package and related classes. However, the Java regex
facilities remain under-utilized. Many developers continue using the
legacy approaches to Java string processing because the regex
facilities entail somewhat of a learning curve. To use regular
expressions, one must cope with the regex meta-language, which can be
somewhat daunting and confusing to the uninitiated.  But the effort is
well worth it because regular expressions ultimately increase
flexibility, power, and robustness, while simplifying implementation
code for handling input, output, and general manipulation of text.
</p>

<p>
This session will introduce the syntax and examples of regular
expressions, and their use with the Java Regex and related APIs. This
presentation is intended for Java developers who desire to embrace a
better way to process text in their applications.
