<p>
The Eclipse project, to many developers, is an integrated development
environment for Java. However, Eclipse is far more than that -- it is
an open-source, highly extensible tool integration platform in which
multiple "plugins" from different vendors can interoperate and
leverage each other, often times without explicit dependencies. There
are hundreds open-source and commercial plugins available, and some
companies are providing their tools as branded Eclipse
environments. Learn about the Eclipse environment: what is the Eclipse
platform, what are plugins, and (most importantly!) how to develop,
test, and deploy your own plugins.
