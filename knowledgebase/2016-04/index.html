	      <p>Project Jigsaw will bring modularity to the Java
		platform; something that will enable better security,
		performance and flexibility for deployment of
		applications. This talk will look at the fundamentals
		of how modularity in Java will work. Developers will
		need to understand that these changes go significantly
		further than just separating the standard class
		libraries into a number of discrete units.</p>

	      <p>In addition we'll explain the impact project Jigsaw
		will have on developers in terms of building their
		applications, as well as helping them to understand
		how things like encapsulation will change in JDK
		9. WeÂ¹ll conclude with a look at how this will
		simplify and improve Java as a platform for IoT
		applications and how this relates to <a href=

		Zulu</a> from <a href= "https://www.azul.com/"
