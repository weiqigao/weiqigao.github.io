	      <p>Spring Boot makes it easy to create stand-alone,
	      production-grade Spring based Applications that you can
	      “just run”, while still allowing the configuration
	      flexibility Spring is famous/infamous for.  You can use
	      Spring Boot to create Java applications that can be
	      started using “java –jar application.jar” or more
	      traditional war deployments.  Spring Boot takes an
	      opinionated view of the Spring platform so you can get
	      started with minimum fuss and third-party library
	      integration is often as simple as including a jar in
	      your pom.xml or build.gradle file.</p>

	      <p>This talk will demo Spring Boot integration with
	      third party libraries such as JPA/Hibernate, Bitronix,
	      Liquibase and JUnit as well as other Spring projects
	      such as Spring Data and Spring Security.</p>

	      <p>Chris Mercer has been developing Java applications
	      for 18 years, long enough to have had to deal with Java
	      1.0 to Java 1.1 AWT event model changes. Begrudgingly,
	      he gave up Java Swing development and started doing Java
	      web application development in the early 2000s.  He is
	      currently employed at Vestmark Inc. as a senior
	      developer but for over a decade was a consultant with
	      Harpoon Technologies across aerospace, ecommerce and
	      Internet Of Things (IOT) domains.  Although primarily a
	      Java developer he has also experienced in
	      HTML/CSS/JavaScript development, build management and
	      devops, database development and administration and has
	      dabbled in node.js development.</p>
