		class="body">
	      <p>Every software development organization on the planet
		has a software supply chain that is consuming a
		massive volume of open source and third-party
		components at extremely high velocity.  To provide a
		much clearer perspective to this volume and velocity,
		we can see that a global population more than 11
		million developers consumed over 20 billion components
		in 2014.</p>
	      <p>Those in AppSec who have pursued improved visibility,
		supplier choices, and control mechanisms across their
		software supply chains have boosted developer
		productivity by 15% - 40%, crumbled mountains of
		security debt, and shifted millions of dollars from
		sustaining operations to accelerating innovation.</p>
	      <p>Yet the vast majority of organizations developing
		software are blind to their free-for-all consumption
		volume, patterns, and velocity.  Their software supply
		chain practices are silently sabotaging efforts to
		accelerate development, improve efficiency and
		maintain the integrity of their applications.</p>
	      <p>In June, we authored the 2015 State of the Software
		Supply Chain Report. It is a quantitative analysis of
		more than 106,000 software development organizations
		consuming billions of open source and third-party
		software components from over 100,000 “suppliers”
		(open source projects).</p>
	      <p>While the average organization in the study consumed
		240,000 open source and third party software
		components in 2014, the study revealed:</p>
	      <ul>
		<li>An average of 15,337 (7.5%) components consumed
		  included known security flaws, impacting the
		  integrity of operations</li>
		<li>75% of organizations lack policies that control
		  the use of open source and third-party components
		  that are making their way through their software
		  supply chains and into production</li>
		<li>An average application has 24 known critical or
		  severe open source security flaws, electively built
		  in by the development team</li>
	      </ul>
	      <p>But this discussion is not intended to simply shed
		light on bad practices, it is about learning.
		Attendees will gain new visibility as to what’s
		happening in their own software supply chains, how to
		avoid these elective risks, and how leading
		technology, banking, and government organizations are
		applying proven supply chain principles from other
		industries toward improving their AppSec
		practices.</p>

	    <td colspan="3"

		class="body">
	      <p>Dave Hale has been an Agile evangelist and coach
		since the early 2000’s and has helped many
		organizations with their Agile
		transformations.&#8194;&#8194;In the local STL market
		these include, Express Scripts, Scottrade &
		MasterCard. Since joining Sonatype, Dave is now
		focusing his Agile experience onto the Software Supply
		Chain, DevOps and Application security.</p>
	      <p>Chip Digirolamo has been selling software development
		tools for 16 years at Rational, IBM, Rally and now
		Sonatype.  His passion for process improvement and
		waste reduction brought me to Sonatype.  Component
		driven development has pushed software development
		even closer to traditional manufacturing and much like
		Lean and Agile, Software Supply Chain Management is
		emerging as the next behavior that software
		development is borrowing from the manufacturing world.
		At Sonatype we utilize our Nexus Platform to
		facilitate key Supply Chain Principles bringing
		efficiencies and security to the application
		manufacturing process.</p>
