              <p>Savvis, a CenturyLink company, has recently embarked on a journey to
               radically improve how projects are executed and ultimately
               delivered. An "agile transformation" is underway and showing
               early signs of big results. What began as a grass-roots movement
               has flourished into a fully executive sponsored initiative with
               game changing outcomes. Projects are coming in on-time, on
               budget, and quality has sky rocketed – all at a sustainable
               pace. This session will explore how agile was born at Savvis,
               critical lessons learned, and key take-aways to apply to your own
               agile transformation.</p>
