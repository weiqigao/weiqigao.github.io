	      <p>Great automation doesn’t replace humans; it enhances
		us. When we are choosing or building tools for our
		team, we want them to play like team members: keep us
		informed, make the easy decisions repeatably, and pass
		the hard decisions to the humans along with the
		information we need to make them.</p>

	      <p>Based on research in human-centered design, this talk
		enumerates principles and challenges of collaboration
		for programs. It lists strategies for eliminating
		"human error" as well as human frustration. Our tools
		should make us smarter, not hide knowledge from us. In
		aviation and medicine, this is a million-dollar
		investment–but when we construct our own tools,
		collaborative automation is within our reach.</p>
