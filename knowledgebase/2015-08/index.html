	      <p>Have you ever wondered why your e-Banking system is
		down yet again for maintenance or what problem it was
		that caused your check-out to take forever until it
		terminated with a weird error message? Misconfigured
		O/R Mappers causing millions of SQL Queries and
		"leaking" DB connection leaks, excessive logging that
		consumes all Disk I/O, memory leaks that bring the JVM
		to crash every couple of hours or a forgotten XML
		configuration entry that causes millions of
		"Control-Flow Exceptions" that never make it to any
		log file. These are some of the problems that crashed
		large enterprise applications in the last 12 years
		(some even made it to national &amp; international
		news). In this session we learn how to avoid these top
		problems by automatically looking at key performance
		and architectural metrics along your continuous
		deployment pipeline.</p>

		class="body">
	      <p>Jeff Fynboh has spent the last 7 years with Dynatrace
		focusing on Application Performance Management. He has
		worked with dozens of enterprise clients to help them
		troubleshoot issues related to their Java
		applications. Jeff works closely with large
		organizations on a daily basis to help them follow
		discreet transactions through their Java and
		heterogeneous applications and to help them develop
		strategies that decrease downtime, avoid the ‘war
		room’ and increase time spent on business critical
		initiatives. Prior to working for Dyantrace Jeff held
		several positions in the IT field including Enterprise
		Architect at Qwest Communications.</p>
