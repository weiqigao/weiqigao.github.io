<p class="bodysubtitle_java">To EJB, or not to EJB?  Take your pick!
<p><b>by Andy Matthys-Pearce, Savvis Communications</b></p>
<p class="bodysubtitle_java">About the Presentation&nbsp;
<hr>
<br>In a December, 2001 JavaWorld article, "To EJB, or not to EJB?" , Humphrey
Sheil discussed how to decide whether to use EJB for a given enterprise
application. Ed Roman, author of Mastering Enterprise JavaBeans , includes a
section about this topic in his book, and the online discussion groups have had
much lively debate over whether and when to use EJB.  This is definitely an
interesting discussion, and the focus it has received is not surprising given
EJB's status as kingpin of the J2EE platform.
<p>However,  rather than delve into this debate over when to use EJB or not,
this presentation explores a strategy, based on two J2EE Patterns,  that provides
the flexibility to easily switch an application among EJB, local class, and Web
Service-based business service implementations - without modifying presentation
layer or business logic code.*  Write an enterprise application and deploy it
using EJBs - or not - take your pick!
<p>
*  There is one notable limitation here. To be able to run the same application
with or without EJBs, the data access method must not use entity beans.  Many
would argue, though, that in most cases, the alternatives to entity beans are
preferrable, anyway.
