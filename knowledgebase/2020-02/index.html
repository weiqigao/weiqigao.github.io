	      <p>Scala is the most popular language on the JVM that
		isn't named Java <a href=
		"https://redmonk.com/sogrady/2019/03/20/language-rankings-1-19/"
		>[1]</a>. Scala developers are happier and get paid
		drastically more on average than Java
		developers<a href=
		"https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/2019#top-paying-technologies"
		>[2]</a>. What is it about this weird FP/OO hybrid
		language that is so enticing? What is it about it that
		prevents it from gaining much market share over the
		last year?</p>

	      <p>In this talk, I'm going to attempt to teach you just
	      enough Scala to learn more on your own, and get you
	      excited enough about it to do so. This talk will target
	      developers with a non-zero amount of Java experience and
	      near zero Scala experience. Scala code snippets will
	      have an equivalent Java code snippet available for use
	      as a Rosetta stone.</p>

	      <p>Rough Agenda
		<ol>
		  <li>Scala Philosophy.</li>
		  <li>Hello Scala!</li>
		  <li>Case classes and pattern matching.</li>
		  <li>class vs. object vs. trait. What do these mean?</li>
		  <li>for comprehensions. Not your average for loop.</li>
		  <li>Java is a strongly typed language. Why do people say Scala has a stronger type system?</li>
		  <li>Let's talk about the FP part of Scala.</li>
		  <li>Performance and benchmarking compared to Java.</li>
		  <li>What is Scala bad at?</li>
		</ol>
	      </p>
			 
	      <p>I am a strong advocate of talking about the tradeoffs
		of technology openly rather than pretending that
		everything is perfect. As such, you'll find that I
		will be hitting the pain points of the language every
		bit as much as the benefits. I'm also a strong
		advocate for learning new technologies and paradigms
		regardless of whether you use them in your day job,
		and I will try to convince you that regardless of
		whether Scala is your next language, that learning a
		new language will make you a better programmer in
		general.</p>

		class="body">
	      <p>BJ Kennedy has been doing functional programming
		professionally on the JVM in Scala and Clojure for the
		past 7 years. A few examples of applications that he
		has built using Scala include</p>

	      <ul>
		<li>Data Ingestion Pipelines using Spark that pull in
		  hundreds of terabytes of data.</li>
		<li>Microservices using Scalatra and Http4s</li>
		<li>Recommendation engines</li>
		<li>Full Stack Development using Play</li>
	      </ul>

	      <p>Prior to going to school to be a Software Engineer,
	      BJ served in the US Army in Alaska for 6 years, and is
	      an OIF veteran.</p>
