	      <p>JDK 9 including the Java Platform Module System
		(JPMS) has finally been released. We'll start this
		presentation with a quick recap of what's included in
		JDK 9 and how this will help (and challenge) Java
		developers.</p>

	      <p>Oracle has made some significant announcements about
		the future of the JDK as well as Java EE. Find out
		about the proposed changes to the release cadence of
		the JDK, the numbering scheme and GPL released
		binaries. We'll also look at the introduction of a
		long-term support (LTS) model and what that means for
		developers and administrators.</p>

	      <p>Finally, we'll look ahead to the future of the Java
		platform. There are a plethora of JDK enhancement
		proposals (JEPs) and OpenJDK projects like Valhalla,
		Amber, Metropolis and Loom. What these are and what
		they mean for developers will be explored.</p>
