		class="body">
	      <p>React is a web app framework from Facebook that
		focuses on the view portion. It emphasizes building
		UIs from components, most of which only use data that
		is directly passed to them. This results in components
		that are easy to understand, reuse, and test.</p>

	      <p>React applications naturally divide into code that
		addresses two separate concerns.  The first is what a
		component should render when given certain data.  The
		second is how events should modify the state of the
		application. React handles determining the minimum set
		of DOM changes that are required to update the UI
		based on changes to the state. This is done
		efficiently through use of a "virtual DOM". Changes to
		this can be quickly "diffed" against the previous
		version.</p>

	      <p>There are great options for the aspects of web apps
		that are not handled by React. For routing, many
		people use react-router. For Ajax, commonly used
		libraries include Fetch and axios. For immutable data
		structures, the Immutable library from Facebook is
		recommended. For data management (state), Redux is
		becoming a defacto standard.</p>

	      <p>This talk covers everything you need to know in order
		to get started using React.</p>
