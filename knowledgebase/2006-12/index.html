	   <td colspan="3" valign="top" class="body">
	     <p>Groovy is an agile dynamic language for the Java
	     Platform with many features that are inspired by
	     languages like Python, Ruby and Smalltalk, making them
	     available to Java developers using a Java-like syntax.
	     Developing web applications, writing shell scripts
	     easily, writing concise, meaningful test cases using
	     Groovy's JUnit integration, or prototyping and producing
	     real industrial strength applications have never been so
	     concise and groovy.</p>

	     <p>This presentation will cover many aspects of Groovy.
	     Topics will include core language features, unit testing,
	     groovy builders, processing XML, integration with Java
	     and others.</p>
