	   <p>There is a lot of buzz right now around distributed
	   source control tools, with the peak of the buzz around
	   Git. It turns out that this is not a fad; these tools
	   really are better for many teams. I will show examples of
	   using Git with Java projects, pointing out strengths and
	   weaknesses. Git's most obvious current weakness is lack of
	   mature tool/IDE integration, though as you will see this is
	   not that great of an obstacle in practice.</p>
