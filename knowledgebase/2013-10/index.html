		valign="top"
		class="body">
              <p>Many people think that because they have a full time
		job they won't be able to work on any open source
		projects. Open source works through similarly-aligned
		teams and individuals, so why do you think of your job
		and open source as two different things?  Treating
		your internal projects as if they were open source
		allows more freedom in how you work. Maybe you are
		looking for a way to spend a few days a week on one
		internal tool, and the rest on another. Do you know of
		a project that is missing instructions on how to get
		started? Fix that! Or perhaps you don't code at all
		and you want to add to the discussion of a project's
		design. With GitHub, this is not only possible, but
		can happen naturally every day.</p>
