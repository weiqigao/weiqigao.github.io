	    </td>
	    <td colspan="3"
		valign="top"
		class="body">
               <p>This talk is a last minute replacement for the
               scheduled talk on Jenkins which will now take place at
               our June meeting.  However, the slides from which I'll
               be presenting are anything but last minute.  I've been
               working on them for months as part of a new course on
               Node.js.</p>

               <p>You may be asking yourself "What does Node.js have
               to do with Java?"  That's an easy question to answer
               ... absolutely nothing!  So why should you bother
               attending this meeting?  Well, it's important to know
               your enemy ... or make a new friend!</p>

               <p>You may think you hate Node.js, but can you explain
               in a detailed way why?  This talk will enable you to
               eloquently express that hatred.  However, please allow
               for the possibility that you may be intrigued enough to
               want to try it!</p>

               <p>Node is a programming environment implemented on
               Google's V8 JavaScript engine.  Node is well-suited for
               implementing server applications that are primarily
               I/O-bound rather than compute-bound.  It supports a
               variety of network protocols such as HTTP and TCP.</p>

               <p>While Node's primary programming language is
               JavaScript, applications can be extended with code
               written in C and C++.  It has excellent performance
               characteristics, in part because its performance
               critical underpinnings are written in C/C++.  Node
               enables web development where the same familiar
               programming language, JavaScript, is used for the
               client and server.</p>

	       <p>Making effective use of any programming environment
	       requires a certain amount of familiarity with it's
	       provided libraries.  Imagine trying to write a Java
	       application without knowing what is available in the
	       java.* and javax.* packages.  Rather than "packages",
	       Node has "modules".  Provided modules are referred to
	       as the "core modules".</p>

	       <p>This talk begins with an overview of Node.  It then
               provides a review of the core modules including
               examples of commonly used functions.  Armed with this
               knowledge, you'll be ready to begin writing Node
               applications.</p>
