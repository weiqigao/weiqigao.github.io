	      <p>While Cloud Computing offers enormous economic
	      savings, and scalability for large amounts of users and
	      data as well as over large geographic areas, you have to
	      think differently about how to build these
	      applications. Distributed applications are susceptible
	      to a wide variety of outages because you cannot avoid
	      the effects of computer networks and scarce computing
	      resources.  Traditional on-premise applications have
	      always been subject to some of these problems, but cloud
	      computing exposes them publicly in ways that cannot be
	      hidden. This talk will explain how to architect and
	      build applications to be resilient under these
	      conditions. It will also explain what aspects of
	      traditional software architecture and design are the
	      same, and which areas must evolve.  </p>
