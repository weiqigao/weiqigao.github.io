	      <p>Java was once a language that dragged along and
		evolved at a snail's pace. Thankfully, that's no
		longer the case. Recent years have seen accelerated
		development of both language features and JDK
		improvements. In this presentation, we will dive into
		some of the recent changes of Java that are both fun
		and powerful to use, discuss where the language is
		heading in the near future, the modern features of the
		language, and where Java is heading.</p>
