	      <p>Java 8 already brought us a bunch of cool features and improvements. Some of them have already been treated  like "rock star", for examples, stream and lambda. However there are still some features not under spotlight although they actually play important roles in our day-to-day work, for example, Annotation.  In this talk I'll briefly introduce Java Annotation and some basics about it. Some new features just come in Java 8 are also included in this talk. I'll use Dagger, a framework of dependency injection, as an example to show how to process custom annotations so as to free programmer from mundane routines. Further I'll show more examples in real-world applications in which Java annotations can handle static analysis and even render Android more power efficiently.</p>
