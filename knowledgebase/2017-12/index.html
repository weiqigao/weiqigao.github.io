	      <p>How would you feel if you knew that any part of the
		code was at most a few minutes away from being
		shippable and delivered into production? Emboldened
		and confident?  Test driven development (TDD) gives
		you that. TDD allows you to proceed with confidence
		that you're building the right thing. It provides you
		with imminent-horizons that you can meet and
		measure. TDD gives developers the confidence to go
		faster, secure in the knowledge that what they break
		they will fix and be able to improve. In this talk,
		join Spring Developer Advocate Josh Long (@starbuxman)
		as he looks at how to test Spring applications and
		services. We'll look at how to test basic components,
		mocks, how to take advantage of test slices, and how
		to test web applications. We'll also look at how to
		ensure that API producers and API consumers work well
		together using consumer driven contract testing (CDCT)
		without sacrificing the testing pyramid for end-to-end
		integration tests.</p>
