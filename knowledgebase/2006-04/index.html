VoIP (Voice over IP) has recently gained in popularity as a less
expensive alternative to traditional telephone systems, allowing free
PC-to-PC calls and with many providers offering cheap connections for
PC-to-telephone calls.  Many companies are also finding VoIP systems
to be a less expensive and more full-featured alternative to
traditional PBX systems.  But VoIP offers more than just a cheaper
alternative to traditional telephone/PBX systems; the integration of
voice communication with standard computer systems and networks allows
for an unprecedented level of control of and interaction with
telephony using standard software.

<a href = "http://www.asterisk.org">Asterisk</a> is an open-source PBX
system, utilizing both VoIP and, optionally, hardware for connecting
to traditional telephone systems.  It runs on Linux, BSD, and Mac OS
X, and supports multiple protocols and codecs, including SIP and
H.323.  In addition to providing all the features of a PBX and many
other features, such as interactive voice response, it has one
capability of particular interest to us: the ability to interact with
external software--including, of course, Java--through a socket
interface.

We will take a brief look at VoIP in general, Asterisk in particular,
and at the <a href =
"http://sourceforge.net/projects/asterisk-java">Asterisk-Java
Library</a>, which provides an easy way to interact with Asterisk
using Java.
