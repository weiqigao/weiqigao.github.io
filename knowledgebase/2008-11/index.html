	     <p>Content repositories are used to create, manage, edit,
	     and publish the information content of websites, manuals,
	     electronic documents, multi-media files, and other
	     computer files.  Content repositories also store metadata
	     about the content, including version history, author,
	     dates, security policies, and relationships. The JCR API,
	     otherwise known as the Content Repository API for Java,
	     provides a standard platform API for interacting with
	     content repositories, including the ability to navigate,
	     version, search, and listen for changes.</p>

	     <p>The JBoss DNA open source project was launched earlier
	     this year as a unified repository system based on JCR
	     with support for clustering, distribution, and federation
	     of content information from a variety of back-end
	     systems.  To client applications, JBoss DNA looks and
	     behaves like a regular JCR repository.  But under the
	     covers, JBoss DNA gets its content by federating multiple
	     back-end systems (like databases, services, other
	     repositories, etc.), allowing those systems to continue
	     "owning" the information while ensuring the unified
	     repository stays up-to-date and in sync.  JBoss DNA also
	     analyzes the content you put into the repository and
	     sequences it to extract additional information you can
	     use more effectively.</p>

	     <p>The presentation will introduce the JCR API and will
	     provide some examples about how JCR and content
	     repositories are being used today.  The second part of
	     the presentation will then talk about the JBoss DNA
	     project, its features, and what distinguishes JBoss DNA
	     from other JCR repository implementations.</p>
