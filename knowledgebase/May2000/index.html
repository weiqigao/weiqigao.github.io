<hr WIDTH="100%">
<p>MerlinWeb is a Java Servlet based framework whose primary function is
to facilitate the rapid development of functionally rich websites. This
is a custom application, developed for a certain environment, but it wouldn't
be very hard at all to make it completely generic. The goal of this talk
is to make the audience aware of what a framework <i>is</i> and what services
it should provide.
<br>&nbsp;
<h4>
<font color="#000000">Background</font></h4>
Meridian Enterprises is an Incentives organization. It manages incentive
programs for its clients. For example, a client might want to motivate
its salesforce to sell more units of a new product. So Meridian will put
together a program, in which, for example, salespeople would be required
to report a sale to Meridian, which would award them "points" for each
sale. After a salesperson had earned enough points he/she may redeem them
for say, a cash check, or a gift certificate, or they might choose a product
out of Meridian's online mall (which was also built using the framework,
BTW). Literally several dozen parameters can be configured to make a program,
each tailored for a specific purpose. To facilitate this core business
function, Meridian contracted with Grant Thornton to build a modern n-tier
system. This project was completed over a period of one year and has been
in operation for a year. This system, called Merlin, is an in-house system,
used by Meridian's own employees. The need arose to develop websites for
certain programs, which would expose certain Merlin functionality over
the web. For example, salespeople can enter product sale claims over the
web, or they can redeem their earned points at the online mall. So, an
increasing number of websites would be required, each site exposing a subset
of Merlin functionality. The task was made more difficult due to the fact
that all sites were different enough that they couldn't be simply copied
and changed. A framework was needed.
<p>The rest of the talk is divided into the following topics:
<ul>
<li>
<font color="#000000">What is a framework?</font></li>

<li>
<font color="#000000">What specific tasks should a website framework perform?</font></li>

<li>
<font color="#000000">MerlinWeb Core Classes</font></li>

<li>
<font color="#000000">MerlinWeb Fundamentals</font></li>
</ul>

<h4>
<font color="#000000">What is a Framework?</font></h4>
A Framework is a collection of objects that abstract out the common functions
of any large project into powerful core components. Subsequently, larger
components of the project can be built by assembling the core compenents
in different ways. Consider the following analogy. Volkswagen needs to
build several different types of cars, a sedan, a station wagon and a van.
It could have each type of vehicle built from the ground up, customized
to fulfill its particular role. While this strategy would work, it would
result in a lot of time spent in development, and would cost more. Instead,
what they did was institute "platform-sharing". They came up with one platform
- one chassis, one set of wheels, brakes, engines etc. They then applied
different presentations to this platform (a different look and feel, if
you will), to obtain entirely different types of vehicles. This is exactly
what a framework achieves.
<br>&nbsp;
<h4>
<font color="#000000">What specific tasks should a website framework perform
(What are the common parts of websites) ?</font></h4>
Any self-respecting framework should do the following:
<ul>
<li>
<font color="#000000">Authentication</font></li>

<li>
<font color="#000000">Session Management</font></li>

<li>
<font color="#000000">Separation of content from presentation</font></li>
</ul>
Some of the more exotic tasks that a framework could perform are
<ul>
<li>
<font color="#000000">Access control based on user level</font></li>

<li>
<font color="#000000">"Skinnable" views of data</font></li>

<li>
<font color="#000000">Embedding of remote data sources in pages (page content
comes from some remote URL)</font></li>
</ul>
MerlinWeb does all of the above tasks and more.
<br>&nbsp;
<h4>
<font color="#000000">MerlinWeb Core Classes</font></h4>
MerlinWeb is built on top of Apache and JServ. JServ is a servlet execution
engine built by the Apache group. Both Apache Webserver and Apache JServ
are open source packages. MerlinWeb can run within any servlet enabled
webserver.
<p>MerlinWeb is actually a set of objects. Whenever we write a servlet
in MerlinWeb, we extend one of these special objects instead of implementing
the HttpServlet interface, as normal servlets do. The base object in this
framework is called the <b><i>SessionKeeper</i></b>. This object implements
the HttpServlet interface and provides utility functions for dealing with
sessions. Another thing that differentiates MerlinWeb servlets from normal
servlets is the use of a special entity class that contains a user's session
variables. This object, called <b><i>ClientSessionInfo</i></b> is dealt
with by the SessionKeeper. When a user logs in to a MW site, SessionKeeper
initializes a new ClientSessionInfo, populates it with a lot of information
about the user, and stores it in the user's session. The reason for handling
session information this way were manifold. All subsequent servlets can
gain access to this object via SessionKeeper and modify it and query it,
and don't have to deal with the Session interface. This allows MW to be
fairly independent of the actual sessioning scheme implemented by its environment.
We can foresee a situation in which an update to Sun's Java Servlet Development
Kit (JSDK) changes the way in which session information is retrieved and
updated. In MW, we would only have to update the SessionKeeper to reflect
the new way. All servlets would remain unaware of any changes, and would
not need to be updated. Another big reason to keep session information
in a special object is that it allows servlets to pass session info to
non-servlet objects, which might do certain domain specific work for the
servlets.
<p>On top of these core classes, we identified two distinct design patterns
for servlets that would be built using this framework. The first kind of
servlet would an <b><i>entry</i></b> servlet. This servlet would be the
point of entry into a MW site for a user. This servlet would be responsible
for authenticating a user and performing other administrative chores. So
we implemented a class called <b><i>Base </i></b>to implement this design.
<br>A second kind of servlet design would be a normal servlet that would
perform some chore for a MW site, like enrolling a new user, entering in
a new claim, generating a report - basically these servlets would hook
into the back-end system a lot of the time. We developed the <b><i>BaseComp
</i></b>class
to encapsulate this functionality. Also, normal servlets would also allow
<i>servlet
chaining</i>, which means that the output of one servlet can be fed into
the input of another servlet. <i>Servlet chaining</i> is supported by some
servlet engines and not by others. Whether it should be supported or not
is a bit of a holy war among servlet developers. JServ does not support
it. However, we did have a need for it, so implemented our own form of
servlet chaining code which resides in the BaseComp class. This makes our
framework impervious to whether the servlet engine it is running in supports
chaining or not.
<p>&nbsp;<a href="mwarch.jpg">This</a> is a diagram depicting MerlinWeb's
architecture.
<br>&nbsp;
<h4>
<font color="#000000">MerlinWeb Fundamentals</font></h4>
<b><font color="#000000">Authentication</font></b> is performed via standard
username/password pairs. When a user visits the login page, he/she inputs
a username/password which is POSTED to an <b><i>entry </i></b>servlet.
This servlet uses a non-servlet object to actually perform the authentication.
This object connects to the backend system, passes the parameters to a
method, and receives, in addition to whether the user is valid or not,
a whole list of variables that <i>define</i> a user in a MW site. This
information consists of such things as first name, last name, user level
as well as other information such as a <i>fragment access list</i> (which
will be covered in the next section) in addition to a plethora of ids that
will make the lives of subsequent servlets much easier. All this information
is put into a ClientSessionInfo object and this object is stuffed into
the user's session for later access by other servlets.
<p><b><font color="#000000">Access Control</font></b> in MerlinWeb means
controlling what a specific user can and cannot see of a website. A user
who is a mere salesrep may not be allowed to see all the things that a
VIP can see, for instance. The way in which MW accomplishes access control
is by breaking up the HTML for a site into <i>named fragments</i>. Each
web page in a site is then composed of references to these fragments. Whenever
a page is shown to the user, a utility class is invoked by the servlet
which looks up the list of fragments that compose that page in the <i>access
list </i>that was obtained when the user logged in. All fragments that
are allowed to this user are then put together and sent back as a web page.
Note an important sidebar of this way of doing access control. No pages
of a site can be viewed directly from a webserver. All page views are processed
by our paging engine and put together in real time. This way of implementing
access control is slightly costly in terms of CPU utilization, but it allows
us phenomenal power and flexibility over what we allow different levels
of users to see. It also means that no user can see any page of a site
unless he/she is logged in. A website can look and feel totally different
for a salesrep and a VIP. We have reduced access control to be completely
data-driven. And the beautiful part is, this functionality is built-in
in all sites developed in MW. There is no need for any coding to achieve
this for any site. This factor alone saves us a lot of time and effort
when developing new sites.
<p>&nbsp;<a href="home.txt">This</a> is what a web page looks like in MW
<br>&nbsp;<a href="fragDefs.txt">This</a> is how the fragments are defined
<br>&nbsp;
<p><b><font color="#000000">Content/Presentation Separation</font></b>.
We implemented this concept in MW by coming up with our own tags that we
embed in the HTML fragments of a page. This forms the basis of our templating
engine. Some people might ask, why did we reinvent the wheel? Why did we
not use JSP? The answer to that question is: JSP is bad :) Why, you might
ask. There has been a war going on in the last few weeks over whether JSPs
are good or bad. Please refer to www.servlets.com and read Jason Hunter's
article in this regard. He outlines the same reasons due to which we decided
to skip JSP many months ago, even though it was the media darling. The
bottom line is that it is overly complex for something as simple as embedding
dynamic content in a web page. In MW, we already have the advantage of
the fact that each page that is sent to the browser is parsed beforehand
in order to determine which of its constituent fragments can be shown.
An additional step that is performed while processing the fragments is
a check to see if it is a special kind of fragment. This special fragment
is in the form of a URL that refers to a servlet, passing it any relevent
parameters. Upon seeing such a fragment, the paging engine invokes a utility
class that calls the specified servlet, accepts its output, and replaces
the fragment with the recieved HTML. What this means is that the web page's
HTML can be written by a page designer, and wherever he needs to include
the output of a servlet in the page, he can simply place a special tag
in the HTML that accomplishes this for him. On the other side, the servlet
can be developed by a Java developer without any knowledge of HTML, and
without any care of where the output of his servlet will be embedded. This
is great, you say, but how come the servlet writer doesn't need to know
HTML? Doesn't the servlet need to output HTML? This takes us to the second
part of our templating engine - HTML templates.
<p>What we did in MW was to come up with a very sophisticated mechanism
to combine rows of data elements with HTML templates. We take a data source,
say, for example, a JDBC resultset and we take a template file, and we
combine them in such a way as to generate an HTML page. The template contains
references to the data elements being fed to it. The engine replaces all
occurances of a data element reference with its value in the data source.
The best way to explain this process is to illustrate it...
<p>&nbsp;<a href="amcircClaimView.html">This</a> is what a HTML template
file looks like
<p>Another point to note is that a servlet can accept the name of the template
file to use at run time, i.e, it can be part of the request. What this
means is that the same dataset can be viewed in totally different ways
depending on which HTML template you combine it with - in essence the servlet
can switch its "skin" as needed. One skin may allow the only the display
of the data, another skin may display the data in a form which can be updated.
And all this is accomplished with the servlet writer not needing to even
know HTML. All he has to do is get the request, process the request, get
the data required, and call the appropriate class that does the templating.
Again, this templating is available to all sites by default. Absolutely
no coding is required to harness this power. Another point of interest
is that the data source can be varied. Our template engine can combine
a HTML template with a JDBC ResultSet, a specially constructed 2 dimensional
Vector, or a combination of the two.
<p><b><font color="#000000">Embedding Remote HTML</font></b>. This is in
essence a corollary to what we covered in the first part of our templating
engine. What it means is the the URL of the special tag can be any valid
URL. That URL will be opened, its HTML obtained, and made part of the page
being shown.
<p>From the above description it is easy to see that it is a simple matter
to develop a new site in MW. All that is needed is for a developer to write
one or more servlets that interface with the backend system and for a HTML
person to come up with the web pages and the templates required to present
the functionality exposed by the servlets. The only other task is to set
up fragment access correctly in the database and the site is finished.
The benefit we have derived from having this framework is that we can now
put together sites in about a week or two, whereas without this framework
each site would have easily taken two months or more to do.
<br>&nbsp;
<h4>
<font color="#000000">Other Frameworks</font></h4>
<font color="#000000">There are several servlet based frameworks and templating
engines currently available, many of them for free. Some of the most well
known ones are:</font>
<ul>
<li>
<a href="http://java.apache.org">Apache Turbine</a> - A JServ based framework.</li>

<li>
<a href="http://webmacro.org">WebMacro</a> - A templating engine</li>
</ul>
It is important to note that the above products complement each other.
In fact, put them together, and you get MerlinWeb's functionality. Unfortunately
these tools did not exist when we developed our engine, otherwise we might
have used these tools rather than building our own.
