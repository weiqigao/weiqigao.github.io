<p><b>By Mark Volkmann, Partner, Object Computing, Inc.</b></p>
<p class="bodysubtitle_java">About the Presentation
<hr>
Axis is an open-source, Java-based web service toolkit from Apache. It is
the successor to Apache SOAP. Mark will describe how to install Axis, write
web service clients and write web services using this toolkit. He will also
discuss the importance of the Web Services Description Language (WSDL) in the
world of web services. Finally, the architecture of Axis will be explored,
providing insight into why this is becoming the favorite tool for working
with web services in Java.
