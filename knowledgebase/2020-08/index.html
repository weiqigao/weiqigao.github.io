	      <p>A key building block for burgeoning software
		architects is understanding and applying software
		architecture styles and patterns. This session covers
		basic application and distributed architectural
		styles, analyzed along several dimensions (type of
		partitioning, families of architectural
		characteristics, and so on). It also provides
		attendees with understanding and criteria to judge the
		applicability of a problem domain to an architectural
		style.</p>
