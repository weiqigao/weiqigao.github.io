		class="body">
	      <p>Micronaut is a new JVM-based, full-stack framework
		for building modular, easily testable microservice
		applications.</p>
 	      <p>Unlike reflection-based IoC frameworks, which
 		load and cache reflection data for every single field,
 		method, and constructor in your code, with Micronaut,
 		your application startup time and memory consumption
 		are not bound to the size of your codebase.</p>
 	      <p>The Micronaut framework shares many core values with
 		Grails, including the enablement of code simplicity
 		and developer productivity. Micronaut offers many
 		additional features for a new class of applications
 		(e.g., microservices, serverless deployments, etc.)
 		that may not be well-suited for Grails.</p>
 	      <p>Compelling aspects of the Micronaut framework
 		include:</p>
	      <p>Sub-second startup time<br> Tiny processes that may
		run in as little as 8mb of heap<br> No runtime
		reflection<br> Dependency injection<br> Load
		balancing<br> And more!</p>
