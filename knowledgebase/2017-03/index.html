	      <p>Grails 3 is a high productivity web framework for the
		JVM. Grails 3 is built on top of Spring Boot. This
		session provides an introduction and overview of the
		framework for developers who are familiar with
		Spring.</p>

	      <p>Because Grails 3 is built on top of Spring Boot,
		anything that you can do in Spring Boot you can also
		do in Grails 3. In addition to all of Spring Boot's
		capabilities, Grails 3 offers a whole lot of
		additional features and benefits that contribute to
		code simplicity and to developer productivity. This
		session will highlight many of the features offered by
		the framework which make Grails 3 a great framework
		for taking advantage of everything that Spring has to
		offer while also taking advantage of everything that a
		powerful and flexible convention over configuration
		framework has to offer.</p>

	      <p>No prior Grails knowledge is necessary.</p>
