		class="body">
	      <p>The Actor model is a simple yet powerful abstraction
	      for developing systems for parallelism and
	      concurrency. Actors are entities that process messages
	      received asynchronously. Akka is an open-source
	      implementation of the Actor model that aims to be "the
	      platform for the next generation event-driven, scalable
	      and fault-tolerant architectures on the JVM." Akka
	      actors can be very lightweight and many thousands can
	      created within a single JVM. They can also be started on
	      remote servers allowing scalability across machines.</p>

	      <p>Akka incorporates ideas from other technologies like
	      Erlang and Clojure to provide features including
	      fault-tolerance using supervisor hierarchies and
	      Software Transactional Memory. Though Akka is written in
	      Scala, it is designed to be useful to any JVM
	      language.</p>

	      <p>Akka is part of the technology stack offered by
	      Typesafe, a new company announced on May 12th,
	      2011. Typesafe is a joint venture between the creators
	      of Akka and Scala with an advisory board that includes
	      James Gosling (creator of Java) and concurrency expert,
	      Doug Lea.</p>
