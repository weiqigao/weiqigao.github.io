	   <p>Terracotta is an open-source Java clustering
           technology. It creates a virtual, durable Java heap that is
           shared across a cluster of Java Virtual Machines. This is
           done by dynamically instrumenting bytecode at load time to
           intercept calls to read and write fields, and also to enter
           and exit monitor locks. Information about these calls is
           then transmitted to the Terracotta Server (which can also
           be clustered) and out to other nodes in the cluster as
           needed. The advantage of this approach is that many Java
           programs can be clustered without code changes by providing
           just external Terracotta configuration. Many performance
           optimizations are performed to minimize communication and
           locking costs. Terracotta is commonly used for session
           sharing in web applications, distributed caching, and
           distributed workflow processing.</p>

	   <p>This presentation will give an overview of the
           Terracotta technology, how it's implemented, and common use
           cases that can benefit from the technology. We will look at
           some code and cluster some Java applications during the
           presentation. </p>
