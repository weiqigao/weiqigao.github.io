	      <p>Maven is a tool for managing and building Java-based
	      projects.  According to it's Apache home, Maven's
	      primary goal is to allow a developer to comprehend the
	      complete state of a development effort in the shortest
	      period of time. In order to attain this goal there are
	      several areas of concern that Maven attempts to deal
	      with:</p>
	      <ul> 
		<li>Making the build process easy</li>
		<li>Providing a uniform build system</li>
		<li>Providing quality project information</li>
		<li>Providing guidelines for best practices development</li>
		<li>Allowing transparent migration to new features</li>
