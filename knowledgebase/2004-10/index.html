<p>
Do you own one of those new cellular phones that comes with J2ME built
in?
Have you seen all of the cool programs and games included with your phone and
wondered if you might be able to write some of your own? This is exactly
how I got started in J2ME. My presentation will show the Java programmer
how to quickly get an application up and running on a cellular phone.  
</p>
<p>
This presentation will introduce to the Java2 Micro Edition (J2ME)
SDK.
It will focus primarily on how to get up and running with the MIDP API
to
create MIDLets for use in with a J2ME enabled cellular phone. I will
show
how to use KToolbar and other components of Wireless Toolkit(WTK) to
create the JAD and JAR files necessary to deploy a wireless application
and use an emulator to run it.
</p>
<p>
Some of the differences between J2SE and J2ME programming will be
highlighted. Specifically I will show how to interact with a user
through
the very limited confines of a cellular phone. Finally, I will show how
to construct a simple game.
</p>
<p>

Some of the applications that I have developed for my own cellular
phone, a Sany SPC-5300 Sprint Vision phone will be presented.
I will demonstrate the
actual process necessary to deploy the MIDLet to the phone Over the Air
(OTA), which is Sprints recommended deployment method for their phones.
