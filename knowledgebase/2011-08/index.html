	      <p>In the Java build space, first there was Ant, which
	      provided a reliable way to build without an IDE. Then
	      there was Maven, which provided standardization in build
	      life cycles and dependency management. Now... Enter the
	      Gradle, which provides convention over configuration
	      approach to the build process and an approach at
	      building that isn't based on XML.</p>
	      
	      <p>This session assumes no familiarly with Gradle as it
	      introduces this new approach at building projects. This
	      session will look at multi-language or polyglot
	      projects, as well as integration to Ant and Maven. It
	      will conclude with building custom plugins for the
	      Gradle build process.</p>
