	      <p>Mechanical sympathy on the JVM - building very fast
		systems with Java</p>

	      <p>In an age where CPU clock speeds is finally leveling
		off, the problems we address as computer engineers
		grow ever larger and ever more complex.  Building
		systems that push the boundaries of these problems
		require a deep understanding of the machines, virtual
		and physical, that execute our code.</p>

	      <p>This talk draws upon lessons learned building high
		performance databases on the JVM, as well as the
		excellent work the mechanical sympathy community has
		done in the past years.</p>

	      <p>You will learn several layers of the complex problem
		of high performance programming &mdash;
		elephants-in-the-room such as GC and thread
		co-ordination, instrumentation and measurement,
		architecture, and specific examples of addressing
		bottlenecks.</p>
