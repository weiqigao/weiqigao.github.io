	    <td colspan="3"
		valign="top"
		class="body">
	      <p>Matt Schuetze is the Director of Product Management
		at Azul Systems. He is responsible for charting the
		future roadmap for the Zing Java Virtual Machine and
		Zing Platform Edition with WebSphere product
		family. He is the focal point for all inbound requests
		to Azul, from product enhancements from customers and
		prospects, to new ideas in industry-wide movements and
		marketplace events. His role in Azul’s Marketing team
		lets him visit JUGs and industry events around the
		globe.</p>

	      <p>Matt made the jump from engineering to software in
		2000, when he left the world of radar, embedded chips,
		and signal processing in defense electronics, to leap
		into mainstream enterprise software. Since that time,
		Matt helped build and ship nearly thirty commercial
		product releases of developer productivity and systems
		monitoring tools by Compuware and Micro Focus. At
		Azul, he brings his passion for hunting performance
		bottlenecks to the JVM and Zing products. He has a
		Master’s degree in Nuclear Engineering from MIT, and a
		Bachelor’s degree in Engineering Physics from the
		University of Michigan.</p>
