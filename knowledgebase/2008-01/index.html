	   <td colspan="3" valign="top" class="body">
	   
	   <p>Imagine the simplicity of REST married to the power of
           Unix pipes with the benefits of a loosely-coupled,
           logically-layered architecture. If that is hard to imagine,
           it may because the architectures available to you today are
           convoluted accretions of mismatched technologies,
           languages, abstractions and data models.</p>

	   <p>NetKernel is a disruptive technology that changes the
           game. It has been quietly gaining mind share in the past
           several years; people who are exposed to it don't want to
           go back to the tired and blue conventions of J2EE and
           .NET. Not only does it make building the kinds of systems
           you are building today easier, it does it more efficiently,
           with less code and a far more scalable runway to allow you
           to take advantage of the emerging multi-core, multi-CPU
           hardware that is coming our way.</p>

	   <p>Come see how this open source / commercial product can
           change the way you think about building software.</p>
