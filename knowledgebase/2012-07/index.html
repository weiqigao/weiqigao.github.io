	      <p>Special Summer Edition: Ted Neward on "Rethinking
	      Enterprise"</p>

	      <p>Delivered as a keynote at CodeMash earlier this year,
	      this talk will help every professional software
	      developer think more clearly about what we're doing and
	      why.</p>

	      <p>The era of the big, heavy, transactionally-oriented
	      client/server topology, as best described by the J2EE
	      Specification and Blueprints document, seems to be
	      over. The era of the lightweight,
	      transactionally-oriented client/server topology seems to
	      be at its zenith. Is this really where we want to be
	      when building enterprise systems? And how did we end up
	      here, anyway? What's the new "enterprise" developer
	      supposed to do?</p>
