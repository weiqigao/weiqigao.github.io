	    </td>
	    <td colspan="3"
		valign="top"
		class="body">
	      <p>When building microservices or web apps, we often
		take the path of least resistance and go with a
		stateless approach. The justification is that going
		the stateful route is too hard and too
		complicated. Based on the state of the tools that we
		typically use to build apps, going stateless is a wise
		decision given that the commonly used backend toolsets
		and frameworks tend to shy away from dealing with
		distributed, clustered systems.</p>
	      <p>However, with the spectacular rise of Kubernetes,
		many developers are diving head first into the
		clustered world. This mass migration to the clustered,
		scalable, and resilient Kubernetes playing field opens
		up new opportunities for how we build systems. One of
		the new ways of doing things is the actor model. In
		the pre-Kubernetes world, everything is an object; in
		the post-Kubernetes world, everything is an
		actor. Actors are fundamental building blocks, like
		objects, that are stateful, are inherently concurrent,
		and with the Akka Toolkit, systems of actors naturally
		exist and collaborate in clustered environments.</p>
	      <p>In this talk, we will explore some theory and code of
		a live actor system based microservice running in a
		clustered Kubernetes environment.</p>

	      <p>Hugh McKee is a developer advocate at Lightbend. He
		has had a long career building applications that
		evolved slowly, that inefficiently utilized their
		infrastructure, and were brittle and prone to
		failure. Hugh has learned from his past mistakes,
		battle scars, and a few wins. And the learning never
		stops. Now his focus is on helping other developers
		and architects build resilient, scalable, reactive,
		distributed systems. Hugh frequently speaks at
		conferences. He is the author of Designing Reactive
		Systems: The Role Of Actors In Distributed
		Architecture.</p>
