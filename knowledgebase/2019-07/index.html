	      <p>About the Presentation: Elastic APM is a free, open
		source APM solution, powered by Elasticsearch. We will
		start with an overview of Elastic APM and learn about
		its latest features, including Real User Monitoring
		(RUM) and the latest distributed tracing capability!!!
		We will also go through a demo that shows how to
		monitor the performance of your Java applications and
		gain insight into your transactions and potential
		bottlenecks. Seeing application performance data from
		the browser all the way through different
		microservices across multiple runtime environments is
		incredibly valuable for both daily monitoring and
		troubleshooting. Elasticsearch is the most popular
		open source solution for logs aggregation and
		metrics. When application performance monitoring (APM)
		data is enriched by logs and metrics from both the
		applications and the underlying infrastructure, you
		have 360 degree of visibility and full observability
		into your applications.</p>

	      <p>Highlights Include:
		<ul>
		  <li>Configuring your Java applications to deliver
		    application performance metrics to the APM
		    Server</li>
		  <li>Leveraging advanced APM features with your Java
		    applications</li>
		  <li>Monitoring calls from the Java application to
		    external REST services</li>
		  <li>End to end monitoring with Real User Monitoring
		    (RUM) and distributed tracing</li>
		</ul>
