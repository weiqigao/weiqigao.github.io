	    <td colspan="3"
		valign="top"
		class="body">
	      <p>Learn all about directed acyclic graph (DAG) and why
		it is so powerful for Big Data processing. We will
		walk you through the evolution of Big Data computing,
		from sequential to DAG, as well as other techniques
		such as SP/SC, Cooperative Multithreading, Data
		Locality, In-Memory sources and sinks, and WaitFree
		algorithms that power the third generation of Big Data
		processing.</p>

	      <p>This talk will also feature an introduction to
		Hazelcast JET, an Apache 2 licensed, DAG-based
		platform for in-memory streaming and fast batch
		processing that illustrates many of the techniques
		found in a third generation Big Data platform.</p>

	      <p>We will walk you through Javaq coding common tasks
		and then step it up to writing full-blown applications
		in less than a hundred lines of Java code, for
		applications such as Bitcoin, Twitter sentiment
		analysis, and real-time worldwide commercial aircraft
		monitoring.</p>
