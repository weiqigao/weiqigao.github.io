	      <p>GORM is the powerful ORM tool that has been developed
		as part of the Grails web framework.  GORM fully
		leverages the capabilities of Groovy to provide a rich
		set of capabilities which greatly simplify interacting
		with databases from any JVM application, not just
		Groovy and Grails applications as recent versions of
		GORM are very easy to use independent of Grails.</p>

	      <p>This session will introduce GORM and quickly get into
		details which highlight what has made GORM so
		successful, including an exploration of GORM Data
		Services which allow most of your data access layer to
		be written as interfaces with no classes necessary as
		GORM is able to generate most of the database
		interaction bytecode at compile time.  I will also
		introduce GORMâ€™s flexibility with respect to
		communication with fundamentally different types of
		datastores including relational databases, graph
		databases, document stores and more.</p>
