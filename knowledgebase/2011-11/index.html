	      <p>Are you interested in learning what a Java Virtual
	      Machine (JVM) is and what it does for your Java
	      applications? This presentation will provide insight
	      into the inner workings of a Java Virtual Machine and
	      some drill down on what compilers and garbage collectors
	      do, so that you don't have to worry about it while
	      programming your Java application.</p>

	      <p>In particular, you will learn about common
	      optimizations, well established garbage collection
	      algorithms, and what the current biggest challenge with
	      Java scalability is today.</p>

	      <p>Eva has been involved with Java virtual machine
	      technologies, SOA, Cloud, and other enterprise
	      middleware solutions for the past 10 years. She began
	      her career at Appeal Virtual Solutions (developer of the
	      JRockit JVM) later acquired by BEA Systems. Eva holds
	      two patents on Garbage Collection heuristics and
	      algorithms, and pioneered Deterministic Garbage
	      Collection which later became productized through
	      JRockit Real Time.</p>

	      <p>Eva has worked closely with Sun and Intel on many
	      technical partnerships, as well as various integration
	      projects with the JRockit Product Group, Weblogic, and
	      Coherence (prior to their acquisition by Oracle in
	      2008).  Eva has been with Azul Systems since 2009, as
	      Product Manager for the Zing Java Platform.</p>

	      <p>Eva holds a Master of Science from the Royal
	      Institute of Technology, Sweden, and a B.S with a Minor
