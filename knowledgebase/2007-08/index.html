	   <p>Security topics in the internet age remain esoteric and
           the domain of experts.  Firewalls and Intrusion Prevention
           Systems are only parts of the complete security picture.
           Application security is an essential piece of the security
           puzzle, and without it, the sensitive application is still
           in jeopardy, even with the strongest network and OS
           security.  Yet many developers lack the knowledge needed to
           protect their sensitive data using secure application
           development techniques.</p>

	   <p>The presentation will focus on tools and techniques that
           developers can use write a secure application from scratch,
           or test an already-installed application.  Attacks will be
           discussed such as SQL injection, cross-site scripting,
           dictionary attacks, role elevation, as well as phishing and
           social engineering attacks.  These attacks can be foiled
           using testing tools, Java Cryptography (JCE), and secure
           design techniques.  Tools and code samples will demonstrate
           these techniques so that you may apply them to your
           applications.  We'll also look at Risk Assessment, impact
           analysis and the bigger picture of security or SOx audits,
           in case your system is audited.</p>
