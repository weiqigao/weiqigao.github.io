	      <p>Lambda expressions (or closures) is a feature that is
		present in many programming languages.  Talk about
		adding lambda expressions to the Java programming
		language started many years ago, and three competing
		proposed implementations (BGGA, etc.) were floating
		around at one time.  The latest Java road map would
		include lambda expressions in Java SE 8, to be
		released in 2013.  The language specification changes
		is happening in JSR 335 while the implementation
		changes for OpenJDK is happening in Project
		Lambda.</p>

	      <p>In this talk, we will cover the lambda expression
		related changed to Java from a Java programmers
		perspective.  We will look at work that is done in
		Project Lambda, and go through both the language
		changes (which has basically been done for some time)
		and library changes (which is still on going).</p>

	      <p>If you are curious about any of the following topics:

		<ul>
		  <li>Functional interfaces</li>
		  <li>Lambda expressions and their types</li>
		  <li>Default methods in interfaces</li>
		  <li>Effectively final variables</li>
		  <li>Method and constructor references</li>
		  <li>Additional functional methods to the Collections
		  interfaces</li>
		  <li>The Stream interface</li>
		</ul>
		
		come to this talk.</p>
