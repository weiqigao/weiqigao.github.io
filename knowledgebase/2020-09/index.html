		class="body">
	      <p>As performance practitioners we have always applied
		engineering principles to deliver value outside our
		organization. But with this growing technology
		landscape, companies are keen on driving process
		efficiency and maturity within engineering practices
		to gain that competitive edge.</p>

	      <p>With the advancement of technology, growing and
		easily accessible compute power, concepts like
		Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML)
		have started to penetrate the roots of how we think,
		how we function, and how we deliver to solve everyday
		problems. The vision, an AI driven, fully automated
		performance engineering—pipeline where you can launch
		a series of tests, analyze, tune and retest cycles
		with a click of a button.</p>

	      <p>How we built a bot that you can use to not only
		trigger a test, but also to fetch results from
		anywhere. How we have built a fully automated pipeline
		that can pick up a new build and overnight run through
		a series of tests, reconfigure and retest cycles to
		build the most optimal results.</p>
