	      <p>Correct us if we are wrong, but as a software
		developer you have two main dreams - enjoy your coding
		and not having to care about anything else but
		code. And if you’re doing open source development, you
		probably also prefer your stack to be free, like your
		code is.</p>
	      
	      <p>Setting up an environment and maintaining a CI/CD
		cycle for your software can be expensive and
		painful. The good news is it doesn't have to be!  In
		this talk we’ll compare and demo some of the most
		popular alternatives for a free development life cycle
		in the cloud: from CI builds, through artifact
		deployment to a binary repository and finally, rolling
		out your release on a truly modern distribution
		platform.</p>
