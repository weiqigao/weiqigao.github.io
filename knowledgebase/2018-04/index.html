	      <p>Go's increasing popularity is unmistakable. It was
		Tiobe's language of the year in 2009 and 2016 and is
		#18 in their February, 2018 ranking. RedMonk's most
		recent index, June 2017, had Go tied at #15, and
		GitHub’s Octoverse for 2017 shows it as #9. But why is
		it getting such traction? What is Go good for? I’ll
		answer that by first taking a quick look at a small
		program to give a feel for the language. After that,
		we’ll discuss the aims and uses Go is intended to meet
		and how the approach the language takes to fulfill
		those aims flows naturally from Go's predecessor
		languages and the background of its creators. Then
		there’s a quick tour of the packages and development
		tools provided with the language. After that, we'll
		take a closer look at three language facilities that
		are distinctly Go: goroutines, channels, and
		interfaces. (Yes, I know your language has interfaces
		but no, they are not like Go's interfaces. Come find
		out why.)</p>

		class="body">
	      <p>Charles Sharp is a Principal Software Engineer at
		Object Computing, Inc.(OCI), a leading software
		engineering firm providing consulting for software
		architecture, design, and implementation. He's been
		happily writing code in various languages to shove
		data through Unix and Linux networks for over
		thirty-five years. Which should give you fair warning
		for how he feels about Rob Pike, Robert Griesemer, Ken
		Thompson and their latest network-ready, data-shoving
		language, Go.</p>
