		Functional SOLID: on the intersection of the
		functional programming paradigm with the SOLID design
		principles - with examples from Java, Groovy, Scala
		and Clojure
	      </p>
	      <p>
		In this talk, we'll explore this intersection. We'll
		begin with a brief overview of Martin's catalog of
		software design smells, which describe properties of
		software designs that have not addressed change
		effectively, and thereby become increasingly hard to
		evolve. We'll then take a tour through the SOLID
		principles, addressing the following topics:
	      </p>
	      <ul>
		<li>What is the principle?</li>
		<li>What design smells does it combat?</li>
		<li>How does it work?</li>
		<li>Does it still apply within the functional paradigm?</li>
		<li>How can multiparadigmatic (combining concepts from
		  OO, functional and other paradigms) programming
		  better align with the principle?</li>
		<li>Examples from Java</li>
		<li>Where does a particular language (such as Groovy,
		  Scala and Clojure) feature greatly enhance alignment
		  with the principle?</li>
	      </ul>
	      <p>
		Robert Martin assembled the SOLID family of principles
		to provide a useful guide to help us create
		object-oriented software designs that were resilient
		in the face of change. In recent years, the need to
		write highly-concurrent software in order to leverage
		increasingly ubiquitous multicore architectures, as
		well as general interest in more effectively
		controlling complexity in large software designs, has
		driven a renewed interest in the functional
		programming paradigm.  Given the apparent similarity
		in their goals, "What is the intersection of SOLID
		with functional programming?" is a natural question to
		ask.
