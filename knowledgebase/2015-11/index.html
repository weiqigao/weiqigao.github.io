	      <p>The purpose of this talk is to introduce Contexts and
		Dependency Injection (CDI) and to also present some of
		the new features coming with the early draft release
		of CDI 2.0 (JSR 365). CDI is the Java standard for
		dependency injection.  It is a critical part of Java
		EE, but it is a stand-alone standard which can also be
		used within Java SE environments.  The talk will start
		with an overview of the CDI specification and cover
		basics: Injection, Producers, Qualifiers, and
		Observers.  After that, will be a discussion of some
		of the new features planed for CDI 2.0 which includes
		priority observers, asynchronous observers, and the
		new standard for bootstrapping CDI in a Java SE
		environment.  For this talk, all the examples will use
		Weld, which is the reference implementation of the CDI
		specification.</p>
