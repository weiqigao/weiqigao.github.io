<p class="bodysubtitle_java">Introduction to Log4J</p>
<p><b>By Brent Twenter</b></p>
<P>
The Log4j topic is worthy of discussion for the following reasons:
<P>
1.  Its an essential tool for any developer regardless of whether they do Java Applets/Applications/Distributed
Applications(EJB/Servlets).  Every developer will face the issue of logging at sometime or another.  Logging is a standard piece
of application infrastructure.
<P> 
2.  Its a timely issue.  An article about log4j has just appeared in Java World
(http://www.javaworld.com/javaworld/jw-11-2000/jw-1122-log4j.html).  
<P> 
3.  Promotes standardization.  Being in the consulting field, I am sure you have noticed that every company seems to have their
own solution for logging.  I have worked at SBC, AG Edwards, US-RX, and Heybridge.  Each of these organizations has a
different approach to logging.  Generally, through their own custom logging code.  Log4j makes an attempt at standardizing
how log files are generated.  Its designed to help developers debug code in both test and production environments.  Very few
times will a custom solution outperform one created by a community of Java Developers.  
<P> 
4.  Even if developers that attend the JUG decide that Log4J isn't for them, it will give them a greater sense of what is out there
and available.  Some of the design methodology used by Log4J might be transferable to their own custom logging solution.

Introduction (direct from www.log4j.org).
</P><P>
Inserting log statements into your code is a low-tech
method for debugging it. It may also be the only way
because debuggers are not always available or applicable.
This is often the case for distributed applications.
</P><P>
On the other hand, some people argue that log statements
pollute source code and decrease legibility. (We believe
that the contrary is true). In the Java language where a
pre-processor is not available, log statements increase the
size of the code and reduce its speed, even when logging is
turned off. Given that a reasonably sized application may
contain thousands of log statements, speed is of particular
importance.
</P><P>
With log4j it is possible to enable logging at runtime
without modifying the application binary. The log4j package
is designed so that these statements can remain in shipped
code without incurring a heavy performance cost. Logging
behavior can be controlled by editing a configuration file,
without touching the application binary.
</P><P>
Logging equips the developer with detailed context for
application failures. On the other hand, testing provides
quality assurance and confidence in the application.
Logging and testing should not be confused. They are
complementary. When logging is wisely used, it can prove to
be an essential tool.
</P><P>
One of the distinctive features of log4j is the notion of
inheritance in categories. Using a category hierarchy it is
possible to control which log statements are output at
arbitrarily fine granularity but also great ease. This
helps reduce the volume of logged output and minimize the
cost of logging.
</P><P>
The target of the log output can be a file, an
OutputStream, a java.io.Writer, a remote log4j server, a
remote Unix Syslog daemon or even a NT Event logger.
