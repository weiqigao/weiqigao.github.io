	      <p>When it comes to cross cutting software concerns, we
	      expect to have or build a common framework or utility to
	      solve them.  This concept is represented well in the
	      Java world with the log4j framework, which abstracts the
	      concern of logging and its management.  The one cross
	      cutting software concern which seems for most
	      applications to be piecemeal is that of security.
	      Security concerns include certification generation, SSL,
	      protection from SQL Injection, protection from XSS, user
	      authorization and authentication.  Each of these
	      separate concerns tend to have there own standards and
	      libraries and leaves it as an exercise for the
	      development team to cobble together a solution which
	      includes multiple needs ... until now ...  Enterprise
	      Security API library from OWASP.</p>
	      <p>This session will look at a number of security
	      concerns and how the ESAPI library provides a unified
	      solution for security.  This includes authorization,
	      authentication of services, encoding, encrypting, and
	      validation.  This session will discuss a number of
	      issues which can be solved through standardizing on the
	      open source Enterprise Security API.</p>
