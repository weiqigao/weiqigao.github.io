	      <p>Feature-Based Development has become more prevalent
		in today's landscape, and for good reason! This
		technique greatly improves your code comprehension
		because there is a direct correlation between the
		problem space (i.e. the requirements) and the
		implementation (i.e. the code)!</p>
	      <p>However feature-based development involves more that
		just organizing your project's directory structure
		into features. You want to encapsulate your features
		into isolated and self sufficient modules, and yet
		they must also be able to collaborate with other
		features.</p>
	      <p>If done right, your features will actually become
	      miniature applications that simply plug-and-play!</p>
	      <p>As it turns out there are a number of hurdles to
		overcome in order to accomplish this. Rather than
		being left to fend for yourself, a new utility called
		feature-u (<a href="https://feature-u.js.org/"
		>https://feature-u.js.org/</a>) has already tackled
		these hurdles (check out this teaser:
		<a href="http://bit.ly/feature-u-teaser"
		>http://bit.ly/feature-u-teaser</a>).</p>
	      <p>The "Playful Features" session will discuss how your
		features can exude a more playful nature ... in the
		sense that they plug-and-play!</p>
	      <p>With feature-u ...</p>
	      <ul>
		<li>your features can be encapsulated and
		  isolated</li>
		<li>they can collaborate with other features in an
		  extendable way</li>
		<li>your components can employ cross-feature
		  composition (even injecting their content
		  autonomously)</li>
		<li>your features can initialize themselves</li>
		<li>they can be activated or deactivated at
		  run-time</li>
		<li>and as a bonus, your frameworks will even
		  auto-configure with only the active features (via a
		  plugin architecture)</li>
