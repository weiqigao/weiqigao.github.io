<p class="bodysubtitle_java">About the Presentation
<hr>
Using Java Web Start, developers can deploy full- featured Java 2 applications
over a network. As easy to use as accessing a web page, Java Web Start
provides one click activation and guarantees that users are always running
the latest, centrally controlled version of the application all made possible
using the new Java Network Launch Protocol (JNLP). The possibility for
peaceful coexistence of multiple applications all with unique runtime environments,
security needs and system properties is reason enough to be excited about
this technology. This month's Java user group meeting will include a technical
overview of how to set up a web site to enable deployment of a Java 2 application
using Java Web Start.&nbsp;
