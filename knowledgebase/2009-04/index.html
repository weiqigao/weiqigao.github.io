	      <p>The Design Patterns book launched a revolution in
	      object-oriented design and provided a vocabulary for OO
	      developers to communicate their ideas. However, in some
	      cases, patterns used blindly can lead to awkward,
	      confusing, or hard to maintain code. It is time for some
	      common patterns used in Java to be reconsidered so that
	      we can derive the benefits from patterns while
	      minimizing their concerns.</p>
              <p>This talk will re-evaluate key patterns like
              Singleton, Template Method and Visitor. These patterns
              have downsides and in some cases, do more harm than
              good. Examples of each pattern will be give in Java and
              examined for clarity, testability, and
              flexibility. Important problems will be discussed and
              examples of alternate solutions will be given.</p>
