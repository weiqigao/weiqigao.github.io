	      <p>Clojure is a new language that combines the power of
	      Lisp with an existing hosted VM ecosystem (the Java VM).
	      Clojure is a dynamically typed, functional, compiled
	      language with performance on par with Java.</p>
 
	      <p>At the heart of all programming lies the need for
	      abstraction, be it abstraction over our data or
	      abstraction over the processes that operate upon it.
	      Clojure provides a core set of powerful abstractions and
	      ways to compose them.  These abstractions are based in a
	      heritage of Lisp but also cover many aspects of
	      object-oriented programming as well.</p>
 
	      <p>This talk will examine these abstractions and
	      introduce you to both Clojure and functional
	      programming.  Attendees are not expected to be familiar
	      with either Clojure or FP.</p>

	      <p>Hi! My name is Alex Miller and I live in St. Louis. I
	      write code for a living and currently work for <a href=
	      "http://revelytix.com/" >Revelytix</a> on semantic web
	      products.</p>

	      <p>In the past I worked for Terracotta, BEA Systems, and
	      MetaMatrix. My main language for the last decade has
	      been Java, although I'm interested in many different
	      languages. I am the founder of the Lambda Lounge user
	      group and the Strange Loop developer conference.</p>

	      <p>Here are some things about me that are true:</p>
	      <ul> 
		<li>I like nachos.</li> 
		<li>I write software, mostly in Java.</li> 
		<li>I have a wife and three children that somehow put
		up with me.</li>
		<li>I have a dog and a cat.</li> 
		<li>I play (in rapidly decreasing level of skill) the
		viola, piano, guitar, and kazoo.</li>
		<li>I speak at various user groups and conferences
		including JavaOne, CodeMash, and the No Fluff Just
		Stuff conference tour.</li>
		<li>I think "This Must Be the Place (Naive Melody)" by
		the Talking Heads is really an excellent song and you
		should check it out. I prefer the version from Stop
		Making Sense.</li>
		<li>I started programming with Logo in the second
		grade and haven't really stopped coding since.</li>
		<li>"The Big Lebowski" is one of my favorite
		movies. But that's just, like, my opinion, man.</li>
		<li>I tend to alternate between reading technical
		books, non-fiction, and hard sci-fi or more often one
		of each at the same time.</li>
		<li>I've lived most of my life in St. Louis.</li>
