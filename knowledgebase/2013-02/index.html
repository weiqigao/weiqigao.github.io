	      <p>The best time to learn and use Scala in production is
		now!
	      </p>
              <p>As all general purpose languages are Turing complete,
		not even Scala can claim to "do more" than another
		language, given sufficient code, convention, and
		headache. What Scala does is radically simplify the
		development of applications that are concurrent,
		distributed, or just plain complicated.
	      </p>
              <p>I will always believe Java is a great language. It
		runs on the incredibly optimized and ubiquitous JVM,
		it is type safe, provides language support for useful
		object-oriented abstractions, and it eschews such
		run-time shenanigans as pointer arithmetic and
		meta-programming. I will show you how Scala takes
		everything we love about Java one step further. Scala
		can generate specialized or optimized JVM byte code,
		it is even more type safe and provides new powerful
		type checking features. It not only adds but unifies
		OO abstractions with those from functional
		programming, and it permits us features like the "type
		class pattern" that allow us to do more without
		reflection.
               </p>
               <p>All of this in at least 4X fewer lines of code than
		 Java. The time to use Scala is now!
