	      <p>The next version of JavaScript, defined by ECMAScript
	        6 (ES6), is packed with great, new features. There are
	        many more significant additions than were provided in
	        ES5. Firefox and Chrome are aggressively adding
	        support for these and IE11 supports some, but it may
	        be years before all popular browsers fully support
	        ES6. The good news is that you don't have to wait to
	        use ES6 features.</p>

              <p>You can use a transpiler today to convert ES6 code to
                ES5, enabling it to be run in current browsers and
                with Node.js. This process can be automated to occur
                whenever JavaScript file modifications are saved from
                any editor/IDE.</p>

              <p>This talk will describe tooling that enables this and
                provide an overview of many of the new features. These
                include block scope, default parameter values,
                destructuring, arrow functions, classes, template
                strings, promises, modules, iterators, generators, and
                more. After learning about these features, you won't
                want to wait to start using them!</p>
