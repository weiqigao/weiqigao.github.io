		class="body">
	      <p>A number of developers and organizations are
	        beginning to make use of Java 8. With anything that's
	        new, we often learn it the hard way. By stepping back
	        and taking a look at programming style as idioms, we
	        can quickly gravitate towards better coding style and
	        also avoid some common traps that we often get drawn
	        towards.</p>
