	      <p>Clojure is a dynamically-typed, functional
	      programming language that runs on the JVM (Java 5 or
	      greater) and provides interoperability with Java. A
	      major goal of the language is to make it easier to
	      implement applications that access data from multiple
	      threads (concurrency).</p>
              <p>Soon Clojure will also be available for the .NET
              platform. ClojureCLR is an implementation of Clojure
              that runs on the Microsoft Common Language Runtime
              instead of the JVM.</p>
              <p>Clojure might be for you if:</p>
              <ul>
		<li>you're interested in making concurrent programming
		easier</li>
		<li>you're open to branching outside the world of
		object-oriented programming to try functional
		programming</li>
		<li>it is important for the applications you write to
		run on the JVM in order to take advantage of existing
		Java libraries, portability and other benefits</li>
                <li>you prefer dynamically-typed languages over
                statically-typed ones</li>
                <li>you find the minimal, consistent syntax of Lisp
                dialects appealing</li>
              </ul>
              <p>I plan to spend a large part of the talk focusing on
              the reference types in Clojure (Refs, Atoms and Agents)
              which are its primary mechanisms for dealing with
              concurrency. Even if you have no plans to use Clojure,
              learning about Software Transactional Memory (STM) will
              be valuable.  See <a href=
              "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_transactional_memory"
              >http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_transactional_memory</a>.
              </p>
              <p>I recommend glancing through an article I wrote on
              Clojure before attending the talk to familiarize
              yourself with some of the syntax and features of the
              language.  See <a href=
