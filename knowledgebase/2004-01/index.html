<p>
Model-oriented architecture (MOA) is a new term for a
powerful concept that has been gaining popularity for
several years: using models and metadata to drive in how
systems work and operate. Models and modeling technologies
(e.g., UML) have been used in the development process for
many years. However, a model-oriented system can actually
consume models at runtime and uses those models to
determine how the system should behave. This presentation
will discuss the benefits of MOAs, some of the standards
involved (such as MOF, XMI, CWM, XSD, etc.), some available
technologies (including Eclipse and EMF), and how
development changes for model-oriented systems. The
presentation will describe how the MetaMatrix products
enable customers to model their disparate physical data
sources and the information needed by consumers, and then
to simply deploy those models as a "virtual database" to
provide unified and real-time integrated information
through JDBC, ODBC and SOAP. 
</p>
<p>
Competition and limited resources are requiring
organizations to provide more quickly information that is
more accurate to more consumers. Providing all information
consumers with accurate, complete, and integrated views of
all the information needed is extremely challenging when
that information is actually managed in many data sources
with different schemas and persistence technologies. 
Custom code to perform this integration is often not
reusable, error-prone, inefficient and subject to changes
in the data sources. Warehouses are expensive,
time-consuming and make "real-time" access difficult. 
However, "virtual databases" can expose the actual data in
the desired structure to each consuming application, yet
abstracts away from the application the details of how the
underlying data sources are accessed and how the
information is integrated. This presentation will discuss
how MetaMatrix defines these "virtual databases" using
models and metadata, and how those models are deployed to
an integration server to which clients can connect via
JDBC, ODBC, and SOAP.

Hauch - Vice President of Development and Chief
Architect of Metadata Management 
</p>
<p>
Randall has been working with Java technologies for the
past 7 years, and with application development for 10
years. After receiving a BS and MS in Aerospace
Engineering, he developed engineering models and
engineering applications for aerospace systems. He has
been at MetaMatrix for 4 years, and has helped define and
build the company's modeling infrastructure and metadata
management capabilities. Randall is also the MetaMatrix
representative to the Object Management Group (OMG), where
he has participated on various task forces, including MOF,
XMI, CWM, MOF2 and UML2 Infrastructure.

Bradley Wright - Vice President, Product Management 
</p>
<p>
With over 15 years experience developing and delivering
advanced product solutions in a number of industries, Brad
is responsible for ensuring that MetaMatrix products meet
customers' needs both in terms of features and quality.
Brad works directly with customers as they evaluate and
deploy MetaMatrix products. As a former developer, Brad
also works closely with the MetaMatrix development team to
provide direct feedback from customers and ensure
customers' needs are fulfilled. Brad also spends time
evangelizing MetaMatrix products throughout the industry
and is one of the original architects of the MetaMatrix
product line. Before joining MetaMatrix, Brad worked as a
Senior Architect at Connectria where he designed and
developed an internationalized front-end to a large legacy,
transportation control system for a major railroad. Prior
to that, he worked for Digital Equipment Corporation
consulting for the Air Force's F-22 Program Office and
developing a secure version of the Air Force Air Mobility
Command's global transportation support system. Before
that, he worked for McDonnell Douglas Corporation doing
research and development of advanced object-oriented
software development techniques and computer-aided software
engineering solutions. Brad holds a BS in Computer Science
from the University of Iowa.</td>
