		class="body">
	      <p>BIRT, the industry leading open source reporting and
	      Business Intelligence project within the Eclipse
	      Foundation, is a new generation of reporting and data
	      visualization technology that does just
	      that&mdash;enabling you to focus on building the core
	      capabilities of your application and utilizing
	      ready-to-go BIRT technology to add rich information that
	      meet your users' needs.  This presentation introduces
	      BIRT and looks at how you can leverage BIRT to create
	      data-driven reports, web pages, and add compelling
	      information visualizations to your application. We will
	      provide some background on the project and quickly dive
	      into the architecture, key capabilities and how to use
	      BIRT. Using live demonstrations, the presentation takes
	      you through using the BIRT Designer to create reports,
	      data layouts and visualizations, and then looks at how
	      you can integrate these visualizations into your
	      application.</p>
