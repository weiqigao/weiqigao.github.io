<p>
The Collections API is arguably one of the most important enhancements to Java
introduced in the first version of the Java 2 Standard Edition (J2SE 1.2). It
supports creation and management of object containers, as well as common
operations for manipulating collections of objects as a whole. It promotes good
OO practices and reduces programming effort by providing common data structures
and algorithms used in most software systems, leaving developers more time to
focus on the unique details of a development project. 
</p>
<p>
J2SE 1.5 introduces another major enhancement intended to improve on the
Collections API, with the addition of generics for supporting parametric
polymorphism in object containers. But is Java Generics really an improvement?
Some believe it's syntactic candy that tries to solve problems that don't really
exist, while adding uneccessary complexity? Other's think it's a great
enhancement that's been needed for a long time. What will you think? This
session will help lead you to decide what is the good, the bad, and the ugly. It
examines the Collections API, pros and cons of Java Generics, and other new
features that provide new ways to use object collections in Java.</p>
