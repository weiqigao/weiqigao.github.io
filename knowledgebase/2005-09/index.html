	     <p>Direct Manipulation user interfaces, based on
	     drag-and-droppable on-screen widgets, can provide fast,
	     efficient, intuitive, and appealing data manipulation in
	     your application.  Familiar examples include dragging
	     files around the desktop and dragging appointments around
	     a calendar, but it is surprisingly easy, using Java
	     Swing, to go beyond these cases to GUIs which make users
	     say "Wow!" yet also provide clear business value by
	     minimizing training and operation time.</p>

	     <p>In this talk you will see direct manipulation
	     principles applied to real-world application needs, and
	     learn how to code the resulting GUIs and integrate them
	     with typical data-intensive applications.</p>

	     <p>While the examples use Java Swing, the idea apply to
	     other GUI systems as well, including SWT and even (with
	     effective use of JavaScript) web applications.</p>
