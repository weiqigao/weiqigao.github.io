	      <p>About the Presentation: Do you have a plan to teach
		yourself Java performance? Is such a plan or
		curriculum existed, what would it look like? How would
		you compare two competing plans? Using a Java profiler
		to tune quickly and effectively is an important part
		of performance, but there is so much more, such
		as:</p>
	      
	      <ul>
		<li>How much load should you dial into the load
		  generator?</li>
		<li>How do you test for scalability in a small
		  environment?</li>
		<li>How much tuning is 'too much' tuning?</li>
	      </ul>
	      
	      <p>Learn all of this, and more, with a sampling of
		material from Erik's recently published
		<a href= "https://www.amazon.com/Troubleshooting-Java-Performance-Detecting-Anti-Patterns-ebook/dp/B07633Q67C/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1515071749&sr=8-1&keywords=ostermueller" >Troubleshooting Java Performance</a> from <a href= "http://apress.com/">apress.com</a>, which
		includes the P.A.T.H. checklist to help you focus
		on the most important subsystems: Persistence,
		Alien systems, Threads, and Heap.</p>
	      
	      <p>These two repositories provide small load test
		environments that reproduce the most commonly found
		performance defects:</p>

		About the Presenter:
	    </td>
	    <td colspan="3"
		valign="top"
		class="body">
	      <p>Erik Ostermueller is a Java architect that is little
		bit obsessed with making software go fast and has
		wasted more time than most wrestling with impractical,
		tough to use Java performance monitoring
		tools. Restart this. Rerun the test. Reproduce the
		problem. Rarely is the right monitoring in place to
		capture the right data at the right time. Is there a
		better way?</p>

	      <p>Erik has spent the last 10 years tuning high
		throughput Java financial systems in North and South
		America, Europe and Asia. In 2011, he wrote a paper
		for an international performance conference (<a href=
		"http://cmg.org/" >cmg.org</a>) titled "How to Help
		Developers (Finally) Find Their Own Performance
		Defects" that won "Best Paper" and the "Mullen Award"
		for best speaker [1]. The proceeds of this award
		financed an 8-city speaking tour in the US, Canada,
		the UK, and Italy.</p>

	      <p>Erik is the founder of heapSpank.org, wuqiSpank.org
		and a contributor to JMeter-Plugins and other open
		source projects. His book, "Java Performance
		Troubleshooting" was published by <a href=
		"http://apress.com/" >apress.com</a> this past
		fall.</p>
